
About Web Accessibility at D2L

Prioritizing Web Accessibility
Web accessibility refers to how easily people with disabilities can navigate and interact with websites. Disabilities may be physical, such as vision impairments including blindness or low vision, hearing impairment such as deafness, or fine motor skills difficulty; or cognitive, such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder. People with disabilities often use assistive technologies to help them navigate the web. An assistive technology is any device that helps a person with a disability. Common web assistive technologies include modified mice and keyboards, screen readers, and screen magnifiers.
Web accessibility occurs when websites are compatible with assistive technologies, support accessibility standards, and are easy for people to navigate and understand. D2L follows web accessibility standards closely and work with clients and accessibility experts to test the usability experience of our products for people with disabilities. D2L believes that instructional practices should focus on helping people learn, and should not be limited by the learning management platform the material is delivered in. Many features in Brightspace can be adjusted to improve access for individuals with disabilities. We recommend that individuals who use screen readers, screen magnifiers, or navigate primarily by keyboard, become familiar with the accessibility features available in Brightspace. Learning how to navigate Brightspace with their assistive technology tools also helps ensure that the features and settings they use best support their needs.
For more details about our commitment to accessibility and our accessibility conformance reports, see Committed to Accessibility in Education. 
Accessibility enables learning
Accessibility is a requirement of all D2L projects. Brightspace products have equal and inclusive learning opportunities and comply with WCAG AA accessibility benchmarks. WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards ensure maximum interoperability with assistive technologies, browser plug-ins (for example, the OpenDyslexic Font for Chrome for learners with dyslexia), and operating system preferences for alternative display and access to web content. This includes, but is not limited to: screen readers, braille outputs, screen magnifiers, color contrast plug-ins, and tools to support reading comprehension. D2L Project Management reviews and documents any exceptions, and shares those exceptions in the VPAT documentation.
D2L also supports simplified navigation and formatting, and responsive navigation for tablets, mobile devices, and other narrow screen displays adhere to and enhance the accessibility benchmarks D2L sets for users requiring assistive devices.

D2L Project Management reviews and documents any exceptions, and shares those exceptions in the VPAT documentation.
D2L has created responsive, accessible content templates that are free to use.  Accessible templates are available for use in the Content tool under a creative commons license on the Brightspace Community. Using these templates, instructors and instructional design teams can create HTML documents that match the look and feel of the Brightspace interface.

Understanding site organization using assistive technology

Logging into  Brightspace using assistive technology
Note: Different assistive technologies have specific functionality, shortcuts, and commands. Ensure that you review the help material for your assistive technology to ensure you are getting the most benefit and assistance.
By default, the Login page for Brightspace has three form elements: Username, Password, and Log in. The Username field has focus when you enter the page. The Password field and Log in button are the next tab options. Your institution might have customized the Login page to display different form elements.
There are two additional options displayed as links:
The Forgot Password link opens a new window where you can request a password reset link. An email containing the link is sent to the email address associated with your username.
The System Check link must be turned on by an administrator. If it is turned on, the link opens a new page that checks your computer for the minimum requirements of Brightspace. If you do not meet one of the minimum requirement criteria, a message appears that explains which components need to be updated.
Logging out of Brightspace using assistive technology
The Log out link is available in your personal menu on the minibar at the top of all pages. The personal menu opens when you click your name on the minibar. You can open the personal menu using an assistive technology's links list, or by tabbing through the minibar links at the top of the page.
Your institution might have a policy to automatically log you out of the system if you are inactive for an extended period of time. Your administrator can determine the amount of inactive time before you are automatically logged out. A JavaScript warning provides an option to remain logged in before your time expires.
Brightspace site organization
Brightspace  is organized into two levels of information. Organization-related information that appears on My Home, and course-related information that appears on Course Home and different course tools.
At the top of each page is a navigation area that includes the minibar and the navbar. You can skip the navigation area on any page by selecting the Skip to main content link.
The minibar appears at the top of every page. It contains links to My Home, a course selector that you can use to switch between courses, alerts about events and updates for you and your courses, and a personal menu for setting your preferences and logging out.
You can jump to the navbar by selecting the hidden heading Navigation. The navbar typically contains an unordered list of tool links for the course you are viewing. If you are not in a course, the navbar list contains tool links for My Home or a department. Depending on how the navbar was set up, the links might be organized into link groups. Link groups do not appear in the links list. You can locate link groups by checking the form fields list or navigating by button.
Navigating My Home with assistive technology
When you log in to Brightspace, My Home is the first page you access. It is a central area for checking institution-wide news and events, and opening organization-level tools.
Like all pages in Brightspace, My home has a navigation area across the top of the page that includes the minibar and the navbar.  The navbar contains links to different tools. Since My Home is an organization-level page, the links on the navbar for My Home usually go to organization-level or course-independent tools, such as  Email and Brightspace ePortfolio. For screen readers and other assistive technology, the navbar has a hidden default Heading 2 called Navigation, and it is organized using ordered lists. There might be other headings depending on institution configuration needs.
Other My Home content is organized into widgets. Typical widgets include News, My Courses, Tasks, and Calendar. Using an assistive technology program, you can navigate and search for widgets using Heading 2, and navigate across sections using Heading 3.
One of the main purposes of My Home is to provide access to organization-level tools and information. If you are using a screen reader, you can view a list of links or headings on My Home to familiarize yourself with the available options.
Navigating the Course Home with assistive technology
Course Home is the first page you visit when you enter a course. To access a Course Home, you must select it from the My Courses widget, or use the search feature to find the course. If you are using the My Courses widget and have more than one role in Brightspace (for example, you are both a graduate student and a teaching assistant), you select the role tab, and then view the courses for that role. Depending on the screen reader, tabs might be read as tabs or links. In both cases, tabs are read as the first content immediately following the widget heading. 
Course Home is a central area for accessing course-specific information. Like My Home, Course Home pages have a navigation area across the top of the page, and a number of widgets that contain information and links. Information and links on Course Home are specific to the course, unless the information relates to course-independent tools. For example, depending on the implementation, the navigation area for Course Home contains links to Grades, Discussions, and Quizzes for that specific course. Use Heading 2 to navigate to the main Navigation area and the different course widgets.
Using Search
Most pages that contain lists of items or user names have a Search For field near the top of the page. To perform a search, enter a word or partial word in the Search For field and select the Search button or press Enter.
Use the Show Search Options link to select advanced search options.
Use the Clear Search link to clear the contents of the Search For field.
Brightspace page layout
Pages in Brightspace have been designed so that the layout is similar across all tools. The way you interact with the navigation area, links, headings, action buttons, context menus, tables, tabs, forms, expanding and contracting text areas, pop-ups, search, and other content areas is the same on all Brightspace pages. 
Calendar page layout
The Calendar displays events from multiple calendars in one view. 
Using calendar view modes
The mode in which you're viewing the calendar is read to assistive technology devices as part of the Heading 1 on the calendar page. You can configure your calendar to display in Day, Week, Month, Agenda, or List view.
The Agenda view groups course events from your active course calendars by date, course, or type. Events appear in chronological order and all-day events display at the top of each grouped listing.
For learners with visual impairment, the List view displays all events from your active course calendars in chronological order. You can filter the List view by event type. To view more details about the event, click an event's name. If the list contains more items than fit on the page, a Load More link appears as the last entry on the list. To append more items to the list, click the link.
Using the calendar selector
The calendar selector appears to assistive technology as a bulleted list of available calendars. Each calendar corresponds to an individual course you are enrolled in. If one of your courses is missing from the calendar selector, you can add calendars to your list by selecting the Add Calendar link. Select a course link from the bulleted list to display the calendar events in the main calendar display.
If you set the calendar to display all calendars, events in the main calendar display do not indicate which course the events belong to. To distinguish which course an event is part of, select the event name to display event details.
Using the default calendar
The default calendar always displays the course from which you accessed the Calendar tool. The course name appears as a link on the page. If you have permission to create course events, those events appear on the default calendar.
You can change your default calendar by selecting the link labeled with the default calendar's name. When the calendar selector opens, choose a course calendar to view. When you change your default calendar, you also switch your current course in Brightspace to correspond to the course calendar you selected.

Reach every learner with Brightspace accessibility features

Accessibility Features for Screen Readers
Brightspace includes features aimed at improving the usability of the system for learners using assistive technology. Design decisions that D2L uses to benefit screen reader users include the following items:
Standard page design. Similar functionality appears in the same place and is accessed in the same way across tools.
Simple heading structure across all tools. Heading 1 is used for page titles. Heading 2 is used for widgets and major page sections. Heading 3 is used to organize information within widgets and subsections.
Unique, contextual link names and button names.
Title attributes on links that open the link in a new window. It is recommended that you adjust your screen reader settings to read the title attribute. When this setting is turned on, the screen reader alerts you when a link opens in a new window.
Descriptive alternative text on all system images and graphics. Brightspace also prompts course designers to include alternative text when uploading images.
Table row and column markup and table summaries or captions.
Toggle icons, such as show/hide, indicate the state of the control.
Skip navigation links and ARIA landmarks so you can skip sections of a page.
Account settings that enable you to simplify the layout of many tools. There are specific settings related to accessibility, including system font and font size, the option to change modal dialogs to windows, and the option to turn off the Brightspace Editor.
Full keyboard accessibility. The tab order is logical and tab focus is visually indicated. Drag-and-drop and other dynamic interaction features have keyboard alternatives. For example:
Rearranging navbar linksArranging links within custom link groupsReordering questions in a quiz Editing the arrangement of widgets on homepages Rearranging criteria while creating a rubric Rearranging topics in the Content tool and Course Builder Adjusting the split view in evaluation screens and activity editing screens for Assignments, Quizzes, ane Discussion tools. 
WAI-ARIA markup for links, context menus, error messages, and confirmation messages to help improve navigation.
Support for browser and assistive technology scaling and contrast options. System content uses styles that you can overwrite using cascading style sheets (CSS); however, the complexity of the system requires detailed style sheets.
Optimize personal account settings for assistive technology
The Account Settings link contains several tabs, depending on the role you have within the Brightspace. You can adjust the settings in these tabs to meet your personal needs; however, the following settings might be of particular interest if you are using assistive technology devices or software applications.
In the Account Settings tab, consider the following configuration options:
You can configure the Login Destination option to log directly into a course, rather than My Home. This option can simplify navigation if you are only taking a few courses.
The Font Face and Font Size options adjust the appearance of text in Brightspace. Choose options that provide the best results for your needs. To adjust the size of icons, you can use a magnification tool such as the zoom feature built into most browsers.
If you use a screen reader or you only use a keyboard to navigate Brightspace, you can select the Turn off rich text editor and view source option. Using this option, you can upload HTML content authored in an external editor. 
To automatically detect embedded videos, turn on the Optimize video presentation for programmatically-driven assistive technologies option.
In the Discussions tab, consider the following configuration options:
To simplify the layout of discussion lists, turn off the Always show the Discussions List pane option.
Turn off the preview pane and show topics in grid view. 
In the Email tab, consider the following configuration options:
To simplify the layout of your inbox, clear the Show the Message Preview pane and Show the Folder List pane check boxes.
The Metadata tab is available only to administrators and instructors. Consider the following configuration option:
To simplify movement through the main metadata page, select the Basic and Expand all Categories options.
The minibar includes a personal menu with links to tools that store your personal information and settings. To open the personal menu, select the link containing your name. There are three links on the personal menu:
Profile - Edit your shared personal information
Notifications - Set how you receive notifications about activity in your courses
Account Settings - Change display settings for Brightspace
Accessibility features for low-vision users
Some design decisions benefit users with vision impairments who use screen magnifiers, zoom, and color contrast functionality.
Standard page designs provide similar functionality located in the same place and accessed in the same way.
Support for browser and assistive technology scaling and contrast options. System content uses styles that you can overwrite using cascading style sheets (CSS); however, the complexity of the system requires detailed style sheets.
The keyboard provides a fully accessible experience. The tab order is logical and the tab focus is visually distinctive.
Code is compliant to accessibility standards. If your screen magnifier supports basic screen reader features, such as reading the cursor location or navigating by links, you can use these features effectively.
Account settings that enable you to simplify the layout of many tools. There are specific settings related to accessibility, including system font and font size, the option to change modal dialogs to windows, and the option to turn off the Brightspace Editor.
System information is not communicated only by color.
All pages meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements for color contrast (with the exception of user-generated content).
Font and icons meet 3:1 contrast ratio with text color to adhere to WCAG success criterion 1.4.1.
Using Magnifier and zoom functionality
In some cases, users who have difficulty reading online and users with fine motor skills difficulty use magnifiers and zoom functionality to increase the target for selectable content such as links, icons, and form fields. 
To increase the size of content in Brightspace:
Use the Account Settings tool to increase the system font size. This increases system fonts only, not icons, other graphics, or user-created content.
Use an assistive technology or browser that supports zooming in. This increases the magnification of the entire page. This option works well in the Brightspace as images and navigation panels resize well.
Use a screen magnifier to magnify a portion of the page, such as the area around the cursor. Some users prefer screen magnifiers because they preserve the layout of the page, but allow you to focus on the content in a specific area.
If you are using equations built with Equation Editor, double-click on inline equations to view them at a larger size.




--------------------------------------------------


Using assistive technology to navigate page elements

Using Landmarks with assistive technology
Landmarks are waypoints that a screen reader uses to navigate a page. In general, Brightspace uses two landmarks:
The navbar has a landmark called Navigation. 
The main body of all pages has a landmark called Main.
Using headings and ARIA landmarks
Headings and ARIA landmarks help you navigate pages throughout the system:
Heading 1 and Main landmarks navigate page titles.
Heading 2 navigates through widgets and major page sections.
Heading 3 organizes information within widgets and page subsections.
Navigation, Search, and Complementary ARIA landmarks provide context on a page.
Using tool navigation links and action buttons
Tool navigation and action buttons navigate areas and perform tasks within a specific tool. Typically, the tool navigation links divide complicated tools into different types of tasks. For example, in the Grades tool, the tool navigation divides the Enter Grades and Manage Grades areas. Tool navigation links are available from the hidden Heading 2 Tool Navigation. 
Action buttons control page-specific tasks. For example, the Manage Grades page includes a New action button to add grade items or categories.
Using context menus
Use context menus to select an action for a specific item on a list page. Every context menu has unique link text that references the item to which it applies. For example, in your Locker, files have context menus called Actions for [file name]. The context menu opens a menu that contains actions you can perform on that file.
Using tables
Tables and grids organize content within a tool. All tables use heading and table summaries or captions. In some cases, you can navigate rows of a table by check box, since some table items have a Select [Item] check box before the item name. In some cases, table rows have a context menu after the item name. These context menus have unique link text so you can locate the correct context menu for the item you want to interact with.
You can select multiple items from a table using the Select [Item] check boxes, and then choosing an action to apply to the selected items. Actions that you can apply to multiple items appear at the top and bottom of a table and use the alt text format [action] Selected Items. For example, you can use a links list to choose Select [Topic 1] and Select [Topic 2], and then choose Edit Selected Items.
Complex tables might have drop-down lists for filtering information in the table. For example, some tables have a View drop-down list to change the sort order. Most drop-downs have an Apply or Go button that initiates the action. Some drop-down options, such as the drop-down for the number of items on each page, update when you make a selection. To use these, press ALT+Down Arrow (for Windows or Linux) or Option+ Down Arrow (for Mac) to open the drop-down menu, and then use the Up Arrow or Down Arrow and Enter key to make a selection. 
If your table consists of more than one page of items, use the Page drop-down list, the Next Page icon, or the Previous Page icon to navigate to other pages.
Using Forms
Form fields on pages in Brightspace have a logical tab order. When you press tab, the focus moves to the next location identified as a link. In most cases, you cannot progress past the first mandatory field until you have entered information into the field. Mandatory fields are designated with an asterisk (*). The last tab locations on a form are usually Cancel and Save, or another action related to completing the action, such as Select or Upload. 
In some cases, you can create content using Brightspace Editor. The editor is fully accessible by keyboard; however, it lacks the non-visual feedback when options or formatting are selected in the editor view. You can make changes in the source view, so you can read your changes in the code as you work, or you can turn off the Brightspace Editor in your Account Settings. If you turn off the Brightspace Editor, it is replaced by basic text fields that accept HTML coding.
Some form pages contain links to additional actions that might not be recognized as form elements by your form reader. For example, there is a link to create a New Folder on the Add Contact form in Email. It is a good practice to check for links when filling out a form in Brightspace or other D2L products.
Most form pages provide either a confirmation or error message when you submit the form using an ARIA alert. The message appears at the top of the page and should take the focus. If there are errors in your submission, the message explains each error and provides links to the appropriate fields so you can resolve the issues.
Reading equations outside of Forms Mode 
If you complete a quiz, survey, or self-assessment, and answer choices contain equations made with an equation editor, you might get the best experience with an assistive technology device if you do not read the equation using forms mode. Out of forms mode MathPlayer can render the equation more comprehensibly. If you read equations within forms mode, your assistive technology might read out MathML code instead of the equation.
Using treeviews and frames 
In some tools, such as Manage Files and Email, treeviews and frames help to format complicated lists of items and options. Most of these pages have options to Hide Tree (as in Manage Files or Show (or Hide) the folder list pane (as in Email). A good best practice is to check a tool's settings and tool bars for ways to simplify the page layout
Using help text 
Many forms contain inline help. Help icons and links to additional help material appear either immediately after the page heading or section heading, or after individual fields. Read the entire contents of a form before filling it out, and look for help text or a help link immediately after a field if you have difficulty understanding the purpose of that field.
Using Load More links 
When a list contains more items than the page currently displays, a Load More link appears on the bottom of the list as the final list item. Click the link to append more items to the list.
Using expandable and collapsible areas 
Some pages have sections that are collapsed by default. Collapsed sections contain advanced or supplemental information that is not required to complete standard tasks. To expand a collapsed section using a keyboard or screen reader, select the appropriate Expand or Show link.
Navigating Brightspace using a keyboard
Brightspace is a learning management system that enables you to access online course material. Users who navigate the system using a keyboard or assistive technologies that emulate a keyboard can use keyboard shortcuts and other navigation tips to more easily use the learning management system.
Using keyboard navigation
Certain keyboard keys have specific actions you can use to navigate the system
Use the Tab key on your keyboard to navigate through the options on a page. Use Shift+Tab to return to a previous option. Brightspace highlights page elements that you can interact with (such as links, fields, and buttons) as you tab through them, which makes it easier for you to complete tasks and select options.
Press Enter or Return to select a link or button.
Use the Down Arrow and Up Arrow keys to navigate drop-down lists that have an Apply or Go button to select the option.
Use Alt+Down Arrow keys (Windows and Linux) or Options+Down Arrow keys (Mac) to open drop-down lists that do not have an Apply or Go button, and then use Up Arrow, Down Arrow, and Enter keys to select an item from the drop-down list.
Use the Enter or Return key to open a menu (such as a context menu, an alert, or the course selector list). Then, use the Tab or Enter key to select a link.
Use the Space Bar to select a check box or radio button option.
Use the Down Arrow and Up Arrow keys to change a radio button option.
Do not use Alt+F4 to close pop-up windows or pages. This action closes your browser window.

Set up and use Anthology Ally (previously Blackboard Ally) to improve accessibility of courses

Anthology Ally is a content accessibility service that guides instructors on how to improve the accessibility of their course content and alter future behavior. Anthology Ally also automatically checks for accessibility issues and generates alternative accessible formats. Additionally, Anthology Ally provides institution-wide reporting available to administrators on course content accessibility and drives further improvements at their institution.
Figure: The Course accessibility score of your course using Anthology Ally.
Set up and administer Anthology Ally
Clients will work directly with Anthology to purchase Ally licenses. Anthology then provides configuration details to add to the d2l.Tools.Content.AllyIntegration configuration variable in Brightspace.
Note: By default, the Instance level of Anthology Ally Integration is ON, and the Org level of Anthology Ally Integration is Off.
Report on accessibility of existing org structure
Administrators can create an institutional-level report to proactively identify and remove learning barriers for learners. These reports show the types of issues that occur in the total content, which include:

PDF, .DOC and .DOCX, .PPT, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, and HTML files;


image files including .JPG, .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG, .BMP, and .TIFF; and


 YouTube videos.

The reports show these issues created over time, sorted by the types of content over time, including filtering for calendar year, academic term, and month. This information shows errors that occur in an organization, course, and file in a course by filtering down from a high level to a very generic level. The report shows a rating based on how the course files were without Anthology Ally intervention compared to an estimate on how the accessibility rating can be improved based on the automated changes available by using the Anthology Ally tools. 
Administrators can export the report to CSV for longer term tracking of accessibility improvements.
For more information, refer to Anthology Ally Help.

Retro and legacy browsers
D2L moves browsers onto the Retro or Legacy list twice a year in January and July. When this occurs, two things happen: first, a feature appears in the Brightspace Platform release notes to notify users about the scheduled changes; and second, a notification begins appearing in Brightspace to prompt the user to update their browser.
The decision to move browsers onto the Retro or Legacy list is made very intentionally and considers a variety of factors including version age, usage, and security and performance concerns. D2L strongly encourages the use of up-to-date browsers due to the high potential of security risks in older versions which may compromise passwords, files or information, or infect the computer with viruses.
You can still access Brightspace with either Retro or Legacy browsers; however, D2L does not do the same in-depth Brightspace testing against these older versions. This means you may encounter unexpected user interface behavior and appearance or broken and unsupported functionality.
In most cases, D2L does not provide technical support or fix software defects experienced in Legacy or Unsupported browsers.
Using a browser below the latest update threshold prompts the message "Your browser is looking a little retro". The browsers currently include:

Chrome 112+ (released March 2023)


macOS Safari 16+ (released September 2022)


Android Chrome 107+ (released October 2022)


iOS Safari 16+ (released September 2022)


Firefox 112+ (released April 2023)

If you use a Legacy Browser, you may have difficulty accessing parts of Brightspace if your browser is not up to date. This prompts the message "Unsupported Browser" when logging in. Browsers older than these receive legacy messaging:

Chrome 74 (released April 2019)


macOS Safari 13 (released September 2019)


Firefox 67 (released May 2019)


Chrome OS Chrome 74 (released April 2019)


iOS Safari 13 (released September 2019)


Android Chrome 74 (released April 2019)

About Chromebooks
Google supports Chromebooks six years after the initial release of the device, regardless of purchase date. D2L recommends knowing when Google’s Auto Update Expiration is set to occur for your device. This can be found by referring to Google Approved ChromeOS devices and searching for your device.
When Google’s support ends, Chrome will no longer update and no further updates to features, performance, or security will occur, and after will fall into Legacy followed by Unsupported browser coverage. D2L’s Legacy and Unsupported browser support is covered above. If Chrome support on the Chromebook has expired, there is an option to install an alternate browser like Edge (via Play Store) or Firefox (instructions available). In this situation a ChromeOS version of 80 or higher is required.
Blocked browsers
Blocked browsers are browsers that are explicitly blocked by Brightspace due to extremely low usage, potential of severe security vulnerabilities, or performance issues.
D2L does not provide technical support for blocked browsers.
When a browser version is classified as a blocked browser, a feature appears in the Brightspace Platform release notes notifying users about this change.
If a user attempts to connect to a Brightspace instance with a blocked browser, an error message displays which prevents them from logging in. Currently, this list includes all versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge Legacy.
Unsupported technologies
As of December 31, 2020, Adobe no longer supports Flash Player and has blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player on January 12, 2021. For more information, refer to Adobe Flash Player End of Life.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do I know if my browser is outdated?
Chrome: Navigate to the menu → Help → About Google Chrome
Firefox: Navigate to Help → About Firefox
Safari: Navigate to the Safari menu → About Safari
Edge: Navigate to Settings and more → Settings → About Microsoft Edge
These screens display the browser version number, and informs you if it is the latest version. Depending on the browser,  it may give you the option to update your browser.
What steps should I take if my browser is outdated?
On a computer, you can update your browser from the screen that shows you if your browser is updated (refer to the question above). In some cases you will not be able to due to your organization putting rules in place or the computer being out of warranty. Contact your help desk for advice or assistance.
On a mobile device, navigate to the App Store or Play Store, navigate to the Updates section, and select your browser.
Will I receive a warning if my browser is going to no longer be supported by Brightspace?
Brightspace provides a warning during login if the browser is on either Legacy or Unsupported list.
How far in advance does Brightspace know when a browser version is at risk for losing support?
D2L publishes the list of supported browsers 90 days before the changes to the Legacy and Unsupported lists occur to provide an opportunity to proactively update browsers.

Hosting Guidelines

The D2L Brightspace Cloud provides a continuous delivery model where your environment is deployed and updated without impact to performance or availability for end users. When implementing your Brightspace in the D2L Brightspace Cloud, by default, a domain managed by D2L is provided for your site access. Standard Brightspace hosting configurations include:
Default Secure URL configurations, such as https://[orgname].brightspace.com.

Default DMARC compliant Mail configurations, such as mail.orgname.brightspace.com.

Default backup configurations and 30-day retention.
Brightspace core data access using data sets.
There are custom hosting configurations that clients can request, including:
Using a custom URL for site access. Usually the URL is branded with a domain managed by the client organization. 
Securing custom URLs with an auto-renewing SSL certificate.
Using a custom mail domain for the Brightspace email.
Using publicly signed and accessible LDAP Servers if you are using the D2L LDAP integration for authentication into Brightspace.




--------------------------------------------------


Default URL and Backup Configurations

Default URL Configurations
A Brightspace is initially configured using a D2L-managed domain, typically with the format orgname.brightspace.com. Default Brightspace domain configurations are secured with an SSL certificate, typically a wildcard Brightspace.com certificate, and configured to respect the latest TLS connection protocols. 
The Brightspace domain is created as an A record on D2L DNS name servers pointing to the D2L Cloud IP address for your environment. It also includes supporting MX, SPF, and DKIM records to follow general mail delivery standards. 
Default Backup Configurations
D2L implements several backup methods to maintain high availability of your data if a recovery is required. 
Note: Client data is not altered by D2L and any files that you upload into a Brightspace environment are retained until deleted and purged from the system by a user. Files uploaded to the D2L-provided SFTP have a separate retention policy of 30 days. 
Although some items can be restored directly within Brightspace, others require a support ticket. Data cannot be restored or merged anywhere other than the original OrgUnit or User record set. Scheduled backups are taken and stored for a set period as described in the following table.

--------------------------------------------------


Using a Custom URL to access Brightspace

You can configure a custom URL, such as d2l.example.com, to access your Brightspace. One custom URL (the primary URL) is supported for site access and navigation. The Brightspace environment is configured to use the primary URL on your behalf during implementation, or when you request a change to the primary URL. You can use additional custom URLs to access a login page; however, all users are redirected to the primary URL after they are authenticated. 
To indicate that your custom URL will rely on the D2L published DNS record for lookups, ensure that you follow these guidelines to create your new URL DNS record:
The hostname must be CNAMEd to the managed Brightspace domain (a desire2learn.com or brightspace.com subdomain).
TTL must be between 300-3600 seconds.
For example: 
Type
Domain Name
Canonical Name
TTL
CNAME
d2l.example.com
orgname.brightspace.com
5 min
Note that the URL cannot be:
A root domain
An alias A record
The same as your mail domain, or used for anything mail related.
CNAMEd to another CNAME record




--------------------------------------------------


Securing a custom URL with an auto-renewing SSL Certificate

For clients hosted within the D2L AWS regions, the AWS Certificate manager can generate certificates for custom URLs. This allows D2L to generate, renew, and deploy SSL certificates to the D2L servers on behalf of our clients without added cost. 
To provide validation that D2L can manage certificates on behalf of your domain, you must:
Create a specified verification record CNAMEd to a provided AWS domain.
For example: 
Type
Domain Name
Canonical Name
TTL
CNAME
_GUID1.d2l.example.com
_GUID2.acm-validations.aws
60 min




--------------------------------------------------


Using a custom mail domain

A custom mail domain, such as mail.mycourses.client.com, can be configured as the default outgoing mail domain in your Brightspace environment. As a best practice, the custom mail domain should be used in configurations for sending system emails and notification emails. Other options, such as your Helpdesk Display Name or prefix OrgUnit text, can be adjusted using the Configuration Variable Browser. For more information, see Configuration Variables and Permissions.
Note: Any custom email domain you select must be different from a custom URL used for site access to avoid interference with CNAME records.
SPF record
To indicate that your custom mail domain will rely on the D2L servers for delivery, every domain used in addressed outgoing mail must have an MX, SPF, and DKIM records.
An SPF record allows receiving mail systems to validate that the server IPs sending the mail are approved to send on behalf of the custom mail domain. Create a TXT record including the D2LSPF record to allow sending on your behalf.
 
Type
Host
Value
TTL
TXT
mail.mycourses.client.com
"v=spf1 include:a._spf.brightspace.com"
60 min.
DKIM record
DKIM records point to the public keys to be used by receiving mail systems when validating the encrypted signature added by D2L servers. Create two domain key records CNAMEd to D2L records.
Type
Host
Value
TTL
CNAME
d2lmail1._domainkey .mail.mycourses.client.com
d2lmail1._domainkey.brightspace.com
60 min.
CNAME
d2lmail2._domainkey .mail.mycourses.client.com
d2lmail2._domainkey.brightspace.com
60 min.
 
D2L will rotate the active DKIM key every six months. When one key is rotated, the second will become active in signing emails, after which the process will repeat at six-month intervals. For organizations that have DKIM enabled and are using a custom mail domain, email delivery may be impacted if both required DKIM CNAME records are not in place at the time of rotation.
MX Record
Non-Full mail configuration
An MX record is required to exist for passing standard spam filtering rules, that validate the sending domain is associated to a mail server. A D2L gateway has been created to facilitate MX validation. However, it will not retain any messages routed here and does not provide full mail functionality. For each outgoing domain configured in the environment (if not using Full Mail), you MUST first contact D2L so we can configure our email gateway for your chosen domain. Not contacting us first puts us and your organization at risk of having email loops that would negatively impact email delivery. You will then need to create an MX record pointing to the default D2L gateway hostname:

Default Mail Configurations

Brightspace is configured using a mail subdomain of the default URL, typically with the format mail.orgname.brightspace.com. Default Brightspace mail configurations are used as the FromAddress domain for sending system emails, notification emails, and user generated emails.
System emails will appear to come from:From: System – No Reply <donotreply@mail.orgname.brightspace.com>To: {user@someDomain}Subject: Assignment Submission Receipt
Notification emails will appear to come from:From: <notifications@mail.orgname.brightspace.com>	To: {user@someDomain}		Subject: Activity Summary			
User generated emails will appear to come from:Reply-To: {UserExternalEmail}From: UserFirst UserLast <user-email@mail.orgname.brightspace.com>To: {user@someDomain} Subject: Example Email
D2L creates and manages MX, SPF, and DKIM records for the default mail domain and signs outgoing emails with a DKIM key as per our DMARC policy. Refer to DMARC and email authentication for more details.
To ensure mail is received, it is recommended that client mail systems follow a DMARC policy instead of creating an approved mail list to ensure that as D2L Cloud IP addresses change, no interruption in mail service occurs. Additionally, following this policy guarantees spam filtering within your mail system occurs, versus possibly being skipped if approved IP or Hostname listing is applied.
D2L does not recommend the use of approved IP listing or bypassing SPF and DKIM (DMARC) policies in any way. If you want to implement approved IP listing policies, be aware that IPs can change at any time without notice and D2L is not responsible for any client data that is delayed, lost, or not delivered during mail work flows due to approved IP listing policies.

About the Users tool

The Users tool enables you to:
Create and manage users and user collections
Enroll and unenroll users
Deactivate and reactivate users
End all active sessions for users
View user and role statistics
You can create and manage users with the Bulk User Management tool. You can also import multiple users using SIS integration at the beginning of the D2L integration process. Integration with a SIS requires consultation with a D2L Integration Specialist. You can also access the Bulk Auditor Management tool through the Users tool.
Finally, you can create individual users through an org unit's Classlist tool (if you have the appropriate permissions) or allow users to self register in the system through the Self Registration tool.

Using publicly certified and accessible LDAP servers

To enable a simple and secure configuration when using the D2L Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Authentication method, your LDAP server should be publicly accessible and have an SSL certificate installed. Using a certificate generated by a Public Certificate Authority means you are not required to coordinate with D2L to renew certificates, as we maintain a store of public root certificates to validate SSL connections. 
Note: As of December 31, 2020, for new implementations and certificate renewals, D2L will no longer accept or store self-signed certificates or communication over insecure ports. 
To ensure your LDAP server is available and secure, you must do the following:
Create a public DNS record for the LDAP server Hostname.
Obtain a publicly-signed certificate from a Certificate Authority and install it on the LDAP server.Note: The certificate must include the hostname of the LDAP server in the SAN (Subject Alternative Name), which takes precedence over the Subject/CN and allows for specifying multiple host names.

Encypt transmission via LDAPS over a secure port or via StartTLS over an insecure port.

For further details on LDAP Configs, see the LDAP Integration - Best Practices article on Brightspace Community.
For further details on supported Certificate Authorities, refer to the Microsoft Trusted Root Program – List of Participants article.

Edit an individual user

Once a user is created, an administrator can edit information about the user, for example, legal names, preferred names, email address, and active status.
Note: To view and modify preferred names, site administrators must grant the User Information Privacy > Distinguish Preferred Names from Legal Names permission at the organization level to other administrators. The ability to edit user information is controlled by existing Manage Users permissions. For more information about defining preferred names, refer to Preferred names.
For users in countries including the Netherlands, Belgium and Sri Lanka, some surnames (such as Van der Speigle or Van Gogh) have one or more prefixes (known in Dutch as Tussenvoegsel) that are part of the formal last name. In some cases, the sortable last name should not include those prefixes. Administrators can indicate if a user's Legal Last Name differs from the Sortable Last Name. If clients include a Sortable Last Name, Brightspace uses the Sortable Last Name when alphabetizing user lists.
The following tools currently support the Sortable Last Name:

Click Save.




--------------------------------------------------


Local Approved Domain Login

Administrators can also set up a custom authentication method for allowing a list of approved usernames. When the authentication method is enabled, only users defined within the approved list can log in using the D2L Local Login. Users that cannot be authenticated using the client LDAP settings are blocked from logging in. This approved list can also be configured for clients using other authentication methods (such as SSO, SAML, and CAS) to block unauthorized users. In addition, D2L Local Login has been added as a third authentication method, allowing users to define two LDAP configurations (if desired) or LDAP and the new custom approved domain list.
For more information, contact your TAM/CSM or D2L Support.



--------------------------------------------------


Preferred names, pronouns, and gender

Preferred names
When user accounts are created or updated in Brightspace through a Student Information System (SIS) integration, each user's legal first and last name are used. However, some users may want to use preferred names that are distinct from their legal names. For example, a transgender user with a different first name or a user commonly known by their middle name.
From the Manage Users tool, administrators can define a preferred first and last name for a user that  appears everywhere in Brightspace, in place of the legal name. For example, the Classlist tool, discussions, their personal navbar, assignment submissions, and reports. A user's legal name is then only visible from the Edit User page.
Note the following:
Site administrators must grant the new User Information Privacy > Distinguish Preferred Names from Legal Names permission at the organization level to other administrators that require access to view and modify preferred names. The ability to edit user information is controlled by existing Manage Users permissions.
Administrators with access to the Users tool and the respective permissions can manage preferred names.However, administrators can also manage preferred names through various integrations, such as IPSIS products (D2L Standard CSV 2.0, LIS 2.0, ILP), the Brightspace Developer Platform API, and Bulk User Management.
This feature does not include the ability to define preferred user names. More specifically, adding a preferred name does not update an existing username. For example, adding Beverly as the preferred first name does not update the existing Ben.Smith username to Beverly.Smith.
End users (instructors and learners) cannot define their preferred names and should refer to their institution's defined process for changing names. 
Name searches return preferred names instead of legal names.
Any existing workflow that updates a user’s first or last name, like SIS integrations, updates their legal names. For users without a defined preferred name, this behavior is unchanged. For users with a defined preferred name, that preferred name is unaffected, because the SIS integration changed only their legal name “behind the scenes”.
Pronouns and Gender
Currently, there are two ways to set a user’s pronouns (e.g. he/his, she/her, or they/them). The user can set their pronouns using Account Settings or, if the pronouns are already set in a system of record, the pronouns can be set using an API. The user  must select the Allow others to see my pronouns check box in the Account Settings > Pronouns area for their pronouns to appear. Users ultimately have control over whether their pronouns are displayed. 
To enable pronouns for your organization, you must set the d2l.Settings.EnablePronouns (Org) configuration variable to ON. Once this configuration variable is enabled, the Pronouns area appears under Account Settings for all users.
To display pronouns in the Classlist for a course, you must set the d2l.Tools.Classlist.DisplayPronouns configuration variable to ON for the org unit.
To allow users to choose their own pronouns, enable the Account Settings > Set My Pronouns organization level permission.
Users can set the optional gender field to their preferred gender by manually entering their gender. The gender field is available in the optional Users - Contact Information function that is enabled through Bulk User Management at the admin level.
The gender field can be included within BulkUserCreate, BulkUserImport, and BulkUserUpdate CSV functions when configured using Form Elements.
The gender field defaults to OFF. To enable the gender field, update the form element setting Is Displayed for BulkUserCreate, BulkUserImport, and BulkUserUpdate from OFF to ON and set the required state as needed. 
To view the pronouns of other users in the profile card and Classlist, users must have the User Information Privacy > See Pronouns permission.
To set the pronouns using the API and not allow users to set their own pronouns, refer to the pronoun calls in the Users API.



--------------------------------------------------


Troubleshooting

Change user password on initial login without the Change My Password permission
If your Brightspace instance authenticates some users externally using SSO or LDAP, D2L recommends not requiring those users to change their password on their initial login to Brightspace as that can result in multiple passwords for those users. However, you may want to have a different password reset policy for any users that Brightspace authenticates directly. You can require those users to change their password on the initial login, or manually request that they change their login passwords, and then change their role permissions to prevent future password changes. 
Use either of the following solutions to request that users that Brightspace authenticates directly reset their passwords on first login to Brightspace:
Email password reset requests to users that Brightspace authenticates directly
From the Admin Tools menu, click Users.
On the Users page, select one or more users that Brightspace authenticates directly.
From the Reset Password drop-down list, select Email Password Reset Link.
The user receives an email containing a password reset request and is able to reset the password the first time the user clicks the reset link.
Change user role permissions after manually requesting a password change on first login
From the Admin Tools menu, click Users.
Click a user.
Click the Enrollments tab.
In the Search For field, type the course you want to enroll the user in or click Search to see all the possible courses.
Click the Select a new role icon beside the org unit you want to enroll the user in and select a role that has the Change My Password permission.
Select the user's role from the drop-down list and click Apply.
Send an email notification instructing the user to change the password on first login.
After the user changes the password, from the Admin Tools menu, click Users and select the user.
Click Enroll.
On the Change Enrollments page, click the New Role drop-down list and select a role that does not have the Change My Password permission. 




--------------------------------------------------


Create an individual user

When you create users, Brightspace automatically enrolls them in the top-level organization. After that, you can enroll them in any other org unit by assigning them a role in that org unit.
Since permissions are associated with roles, assigning a user a role in an org unit determines that user’s permission settings for the org unit.
Unless a user’s role is defined as cascading in the Roles and Permissions tool, enrollment in an org unit applies only to the specified org unit and does not include any org units beneath it. For example, if you enroll a user in the English Department org unit, this does not give them access to any of the course offerings in that department unless their role is cascading.
To protect the privacy of enrolled learners, administrators can also define preferred names that are distinct from legal names. For example, a transgender user with a different first name or a user commonly known by their middle name. Once set, the user's preferred name appears everywhere in Brightspace, in place of the legal name. To view and modify preferred names, site administrators must grant the User Information Privacy > Distinguish Preferred Names from Legal Names permission at the organization level to other administrators.
For users in countries including the Netherlands, Belgium and Sri Lanka, some surnames (such as Van der Speigle or Van Gogh) have one or more prefixes (known in Dutch as Tussenvoegsel) that are part of the formal last name. In some cases, the sortable last name should not include those prefixes. Administrators can indicate if a user's Legal Last Name differs from the Sortable Last Name. If clients include a Sortable Last Name, Brightspace uses the Sortable Last Name when alphabetizing user lists.
The following tools currently support the Sortable Last Name:
Classlist

Quizzes
Assignments

Content - Completion Summary
 The ability to edit user information is controlled by existing Manage Users permissions. For more information, see Preferred names.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Users > New User.
In the fields that appear on the screen, enter an org defined ID, legal first name, preferred first name (optional), middle name, legal last name, preferred last name (optional), sortable last name (optional) and email address for the user. Note: The OrgDefinedID field supports the use of the character (*). 
From the Role drop-down list, choose a role. If you select a cascading role, the user is enrolled with that role in all org units in the organization.
Type a username for the user based on user naming conventions (if applicable) at your organization. If you leave the Username field blank, the system creates the username as firstname.lastname. If the username is taken, the system adds a number to the user’s first name: firstname###.lastname. Do not include the following characters in usernames: \ / : * ? “ < > | ‘ , ; ( ) [ ]
If you select the Manually set password check box, you should also select the Force password change on login check box. If you don’t type a password the system assigns a seven-character alpha-numeric one by default.

Configure the display of items on the learner profile card

The Profile Cards tool allows you to control which items display in the learner profile card, such as picture, email, and online status. For example, when hovering over a learner’s name or profile picture in the New Assignment Evaluation Experience, the learner’s user profile card appears. By default, the card displays the user’s online/offline status, as well as links to:

Email


Instant Message


User progress


User profile


Org defined ID

Note: If enabled, the Org defined ID only displays in learner profile cards from the New Assignment Evaluation Experience.
Clicking any of the links in the profile card opens a new window.

Figure: Hovering over the name of profile image of a learner opens a profile card with links to email and instant message the learner, plus User Progress and the learner’s User Profile.
Note the following:

D2L recommends displaying the Org Defined Id field only if existing business rules are satisfied, such as User Information Privacy permissions and the d2l.Settings.OrgHasOrgDefinedId configuration variable.


The User Profile card also respects the settings in User Information Privacy, Admin Configuration, Preferred Names, and Online Status Preference.


If enabled, the value of the Org Defined Id field also appears in the old User Profile card and the new web components.


Display of the Org Defined Id field is not affected by the d2l.Tools.Discuss.User.ShowOrgDefinedId configuration variable.

To configure the display of items on the profile card
                From the Admin Tools menu, click Profile Cards.
                Check the items to display in a learner's profile card.

Create a file for the Bulk User Management tool

Bulk user management is a key administrative workflow that is integral to implementation and ongoing user management by users who may not typically have a Student Information System (SIS) or Human Resources Information System (HRIS). Administrators can use the Bulk Management Tool to manually create files to import content, or can use a downloadable CSV template to add the required information. The template is intended to simplify the process for new users, while enabling more experienced users to continue using existing files without disrupting their existing workflows. 
Throughout the Bulk User Management workflow, there is information in the page headers to define the current step in the process and describe the pages of the workflow. The page layout also supports the workflow with links to instructions to reduce the need for prior understanding of the Bulk User Management process.
Using the CSV template
If you are using Bulk User Management for the first time or creating a new CSV file, downloading the CSV template is a helpful aid to more easily and accurately adding the required information. You can download the CSV file template from the Bulk User Management instructions window. The template includes a header row that is dynamically updated based on the Bulk User Form elements configuration.

In Admin Tools, select Users.


Click the Bulk User Management tab.


Click View Instructions on creating your CSV file.


In the popup, scroll down to the Available Actions table.


Do one of the following:

Click Download Create Template if you are creating a new CSV file.


Click Download Update Template if you are updating an existing file. 


Click Download Delete Template to delete existing users.


Click Download Enroll Template to enroll an existing user in a specific Org unit.


Click Download Unenroll Template to remove an existing user from a specific Org unit.


Click Download Import Template to create a new user and enroll the user in a specific Org unit. 



If appropriate, review the Bulk User Management instructions in the popup for guidance on file format, required and optional fields, active status, and roles.

After you have downloaded the file, you can manually enter and/or update the information for your users. 
Note: The workflow for updating the users' information is the same whether you are using the downloaded template, or using a manually created CSV file. 
Adding entries to your CSV file
The Bulk User Management tool lets you create CSV and TXT files that are compatible with the Brightspace. You must include the fields listed in this section of the help in a specific order for each action. 
File Format
Import files must be CSV files with file extension .csv or .txt. You must separate all fields with commas, and all records must occur on a separate line. If you are creating your BUM input as a TXT file, you can denote blank fields with two commas with nothing separating them (,,), or two commas with a space separating them(, ,). The Bulk User Management tool accepts either format.
Required Fields
An asterisk (*) denotes a required field.
Optional Fields
Optional fields do not begin with an asterisk symbol.
An empty or blank field causes no change to user information.
To indicate that a field should be cleared or deleted, use #CLEAR.
Is Active
When specifying whether a user is active or not, use 1 to indicate the user should be active or 0 to indicate the user should be inactive.
Roles
You can assign and remove users from roles that you have permissions to change. To add or remove roles from this list access the permissions for your role under the Users tool.
Available Actions
The Create action creates a new user. If the user already exists, no action will be performed. When you update fields indicated with a dagger (†) in the BulkUserCreate form element, it results in updates to Contact Information in both User Profile and User Management. The format of this action is as follows:
CREATE, Username, Org Defined ID, *First Name, *Last Name, Password, *Role Name, Is Active, *Email
The Update action updates information for an existing user. When you update fields indicated with a dagger (†) in the BulkUserUpdate form element, it results in updates to Contact Information in both the User Profile and User Management. The format of this action is as follows:
UPDATE, *Username, Org Defined ID, First Name, Last Name, Password, Is Active, Email
The Delete action deletes an existing user. The format of this action is as follows:
DELETE, *Username, Org Defined ID
The Enroll action enrolls an existing user in a specified org unit. The format of this action is as follows:
ENROLL, *Username, Org Defined ID, *Role Name, *Org Unit Code
The Unenroll action unenrolls an existing user from a specified org unit. The format of this action is as follows:
UNENROLL, *Username, Org Defined ID, *Org Unit Code
The Import action creates a new user and enrolls the user in a specified Org Unit. When you update fields indicated with a dagger (†) in the BulkUserImport form element, it results in updates to Contact Information in both the User Profile and User Management. The format of this action is as follows:
IMPORT, Username, Org Defined ID, *First Name, *Last Name, Password, *Role Name, Is Active, *Email, *Org Unit Code
To display the columns you want to appear in the CREATE, IMPORT, and UPDATE CSV files:
In Form Elements, expand the BulkUserCreate, BulkUserImport, or BulkUserUpdate form element.
Click on the form item name and then click Edit.
Select the Is Displayed checkbox.
To make this column a required column, select the Is Required checkbox.
Click Save.
Previewing and verifying your CSV file
To verify the integrity of the user data you are adding to the CSV file, you can download results from the Preview and Summary pages to review data and correct errors. The ability to download a file to review in your CSV/TXT editor provides features of the editor that can help you find missed, failed entries, or errors that you can more easily communicate to colleagues supplying the data. You can also download a CSV to compliment the onscreen table information available within the preview (prior to running/review stage) and summary (completion of running/end of run stage). The downloadable CSV file contains data from the original upload along with the line number, status (Success, Error, Critical Error, or Warning) and a summary of the error/warning text to help troubleshoot and correct errors.

Enroll users into Classlist with a file

Grant the Enroll via File permission
In some cases, it may be appropriate to create a course that has a classlist that does not originate from data in the SIS (For example, for all Resident Assistants or all Phys.Ed students). In this case, the Enroll via File permission can provide Course Administrators with another option for enrolling large groups of participants. Administrators must ensure that teachers have the appropriate permissions to enroll participants using a file. After the permission is granted, a course administrator or teacher can set up a classlist using a file.
To grant the Enroll via File permission
In Admin Tools, under Security, select Roles and Permissions.
In the Role and Description table, select Administrator.
From the Filter by Tool droplist, select Classlist.
Ensure the Enroll Via File permission is turned on for the appropriate levels. By default, it is applied for the Administrator role to Organization, Course Template, and Course Offering.
Repeat the process for any other roles (such as teacher) that should have this permission.
Click Save and Close.
Create a .TXT or .CSV import file
 You can create a .TXT or .CSV file to import users into a Classlist. Before you create an import file, consider the following:
If the Org Defined ID exists in the Brightspace, the course participant will be enrolled. The import file does not change names or emails that exist in the system. If the import process finds an Org Defined ID is already enrolled in the course, it rejects the row. If the Org Defined ID does not exist in the Brightspace, the participants are imported as new people in the system.
To create an import file
In the course where you want to import class participants, browse to Classlist.
Click Add Participants and select Import users from a file on your computer.
Click Sample Text File to download the sample file.
Add the following field information, separated by commas: Org Defined ID, *First Name, *Last Name, Email, *Section, *Role, Change Password (true/false)
            Note: The asterisk (*) denotes a required field. Optional fields can be blank without affecting the import. Note that not all courses include sections. If the course includes sections, then the sample file and the import file should include the section code. If the course does not have sections, the section code is not in the sample file, and should not be included in the import file. For example: JD4680, John, Doe, johndoe@exampleschool.com, student, false
Save as a .TXT or .CSV file in ASCII format.
Import course participants using a file
In the course where you want to import class participants, browse to Classlist.
Click Add Participants and select Import users from a file on your computer.
Click Choose File and browse to the location of the participant list.
If appropriate, select one of the Send email options.
Click Import.

About Org administration

In Brightspace, the organization (org) is the top tier of the organization unit type hierarchy. Within an org, there are org units, the standard building block of Brightspace.  Org units are organized into an org structure and can have multiple org unit types (for example, department, semester, or course offering).  Each org unit has an org unit code used to identify it between Integration Pack for Student Information Systems (IPSIS) and your Student Information System (SIS).
Org administration tasks include:
Define an organization's structure with the Org Unit Type Editor
Define org units within an organization with the Org Unit Editor
Create, import, enroll, and manage users with the Users tool
Search and navigate the org units in which learners are enrolled with the My Org Units custom widget
Configure tool functionality with the Config Variable Browser
Customize the login page with the Login Page Management tool
Set a language pack with the Manage Languages tool
Configure cultural formatting and languages with the Manage Locales tool
Define locations in your organization with the Locations tool and assign seats to learners with the Seating Chart tool
Org Structures in Brightspace
An org structure is a software architecture construct designed by D2L to offer maximum flexibility to our clients when creating their online learning presence. It resembles a tree structure of organizational units (often referred to as org units), with each org unit typically, but not necessarily, representing a group of users or particular organization level within the client's business model. For example, the root level of the org structure could be a university, a ministry of education, or a corporate organization. Because of the tree-like structure, there is a path of descendants from a particular org unit down to a leaf node, and a path of ancestors up to the root node. The path between the organization structure root and the leaf nodes (courses) may include several layers of academic faculties, schools, academic or corporate departments, and so on. 
While mostly shaped like a general tree, org structures are actually directed acyclic graph, since it is possible for certain nodes to have more than one ancestor. In order to avoid circular routes when tracing ancestor and descendant paths, D2L places a restriction that no two org units on a path can be of the same org type; however, it is still possible to have a flexible org structure with this restriction in place.
Org Units and Org Unit types
Every org unit has a specific org unit type. There are three of org unit types:
System-defined org unit types are pre-defined by the Brightspace platform and exist when a client sets up their instance. For example, Organizations.
Custom org unit types are created by users through the Config Variable Browser. For example, Facilities.
Common Custom org unit types are created by users, but are not created through the Config Variable Browse. They have special properties within the Brightspace platform. For example, Departments.
While all types of org units share common properties, such as ancestors, descendants, and the ability to enroll users, org units that belong to either the System-defined org unit type or Common Custom org unit types have additional features and properties as listed in this section of this article. These features and properties are common in most organizations; however, they are not necessarily applicable in all organizations.
Note: Org units of the same type cannot be part of the same ancestor or descendant path within an org structure. 
When you work with org unit types, D2L recommends that you try to keep the organizational structure as simple as possible for your implementation. Complicated organizational structures generally result in a need for extensive maintenance without the benefit of added functionality. The system enforces lineage; an org unit cannot be the descendant of another org unit of the same org unit type. For example, a department cannot be the descendant of another department. 
When you rename a default org unit type the change applies to all organizations on your instance, except for department org unit type. If you rename the department org unit type the change only applies to the organization where you made the change. Department type org units are the only default org unit type that you can delete. If you delete the department org unit type, it is only deleted from the organization where you deleted it. If you create a new org unit type after deleting the department org unit type and set the type to department, the system will recreate the department org unit type.
Organization Org Unit type
The Organization Org Unit type is system-defined and is  typically the root node of the org tree structure, and there is only one per organization. The Organization home page is available when a user clicks My Home. Internal email address domains are assigned at the Organization level and cannot be set at any other level. 
Course Template Org Unit type
The Course Template Org Unit type is system-defined. Course Templates store files and data that is common to many descendant course offerings. Course Templates can be direct descendants of Organizations or Departments. The difference between a Course Template and a Course Offering is in the frequency of the offering. Across many semesters, learners take different course offerings from the same course template. For example,  CS 488 itself is a Course Templatem whereas CS 488 in a fall term and CS 488 in the winter term are both Course Offering. Typically, a Course Template is not attached to a Semester; whereas, the descendant Course Offering is. As result, different Course Offerings attached to the same Course Template can belong to different semesters. 
Course Offering Org Unit type
The Course Offering Org Unit type is system-defined. Course Offerings are instances of a course, and are typically direct descendants of Course Templates and Semesters. To reach a Course Offering's home page, click Course Home in the Course Offering. Content, quizzes, grades, and discussions are all typically associated with Course Offerings.
Semester Org Unit type
The Semester Org Unit type can be system defined or common custom.  Semesters are usually direct descendants of the Organization and organize Course Offerings into time categories. You aren’t required to have an org unit type set as a semester. For example, if your organization uses open-ended course offerings that continue for years with new users enrolling whenever they like, then you might not use a Semester org unit type. However, if you choose to not use a Semester org unit type, be aware of the following considerations:
If you’re using SIS Integration, the mapping process assumes that course offerings are associated with semesters. If your SIS has structure corresponding to semesters, you will probably need to have this type in your D2L system as well.
When an org unit type is set as semester, org units of that type are listed in the Semester field when creating new course offerings or editing existing ones. This field is controlled by the form element in the CreateCourse and CourseOfferingInfo forms. The name of the field is updated to match the name of the org unit type set as the semester standard type.
If your My Courses widget groups course offerings by semester, the system uses the org units of the corresponding standard semester type to group course offerings. If no org unit type is set to semester, course offerings are not grouped.
Group Org Unit type
The Group Org Unit type is system-defined. Groups are typically direct descendants of Course Offerings. Groups separate learners into working groups for projects and assignments, or create special work areas for users with different learning needs. Each Group org unit has a group type associated with it, and multiple group types can exist in a Course Offering. For example, if there are three projects with different groups in a course, each project has a separate group type. Groups are not managed independently from an instructor or administrator's point of view; if they can see and manage one Group, they can see and manage them all.
Users can belong to any number of groups in the same course and each group can have its own discussion forums and assignment submission folders to work in. 
Next Steps: You can create categories to set up, organize, and manage related groups. You must create these categories and groups before adding learners to groups. For more information, refer to Create categories and groups.
Section Org Unit type
The Section Org Unit type is system-defined. Sections are a special type of manageable Group in which instructors and administrators can see and manage only the sections in which they are enrolled. This permits multiple instructors and teaching assistants to be enrolled in the same Course Offering, but only be able to see and manage learners in their specific sections. For example, a large university Course Offering may have 2000 learners and 10 instructors. Sections enable each instructor to teach and assess the same curriculum to the same 200 learners in their respective section. 
Department Org Unit type
The Department Org Unit type is common custom. Departments are typically direct descendants of Organizations. If an Organization creates a Department org unit type, users creating Course Templates through the Manage Courses interface have the option of associating the new Course Template with a Department. Departments organize Course Offerings into subject categories.  Users creating new Course Offerings can observe the departments under which their new Course Offering appears. 
if you choose to not use a Department Org Unit type, be aware of the following considerations:
If you’re using SIS Integration, the mapping process assumes that  course templates are associated with departments. If your SIS has structure corresponding to departments, you will probably need to have this type in your D2L system as well.
When an org unit type is set as department, org units of that type are listed in the Department field when creating or editing a course template, and when editing a course offering. This field is controlled by the form element in the CreateCourse and CourseOfferingInfo forms. The name of the field is updated to match the name of the org unit type set as the department standard type.
If your My Courses widget groups course offerings by department, the system uses the org units of the corresponding standard department type to group course offerings. If no org unit type is set to department, course offerings are not grouped.
Using roles, permissions, and user enrollments
The org structure architecture is even more powerful and effective when used in conjunction with roles, permissions, and user enrollments. To access a particular org unit in the org structure, a user must be enrolled in the org unit, and you must also specify the user's role. You cannot enroll a user in an org unit without a role. The role, along with the org unit type, determines the user's permissions within the org unit. 
Permissions
You can manage permissions using the Roles and Permissions option of your Admin Tools to set hundreds of privileges throughout your org units. New permissions are created as part of Brightspace releases; users cannot create new permissions. Permissions are granted to roles at the org unit type level. For example, this means that if the role Teaching Assistant (TA) is given the permissions Grade Assignments in all course offerings, any user enrolled in a course offering as a TA can grade assignments. 
Roles
Users can increase the flexibility of the system of permissions by adding custom roles to the default roles (Learner, Instructor, and Administrator) provided by D2L. This means that, for example, in one course offering you did not want TAs to grade assignments, system administrators could create a new role called Teaching Assistant 2 (TA2) which had all the same permissions as the original TA role except the permission to grade assignments. Then instead of enrolling users as TAs in the one course offering that was different, they could enroll as TA2.
Roles and Enrollments
The org structure does not restrict users to the same role across the entire organization. It is possible for a user to be an instructor in one Course Offering and a learner in another without the possibility of the using their instructor permissions to modify grades in the course where they are a learner. Complex interactions between users, roles, and security is possible using the org structure. For example, a user may be an administrator in every org unit in the platform except a single course where the user is a learner. This scenario is unlikely, as Administrator is a cascading role, but it is possible. 
Org Structure Access
The Org Structure itself is not governed by explicit role permissions as are other domains in Brightspace. All users enrolled at the organization level have implicit access to some details about the Org Structure, regardless of their designated role. A user can access the Org Structure details only after the user has authenticated and logged into the organization. Aspects of the Org Structure that are visible to all users enrolled at the organization are as follows:
Individual Org Unit Properties, such as Org Unit Name; Code; Org Unit Id; Start Date and End Date; whether the Org Unit is Active or Inactive; Org Unit Description; Org Unit image.
Some route endpoints into other domains that the user may be able to access depending on permissions in other domains.
The Org Unit’s ancestors' details if the user is entitled to see them (such as Individual Org Unit Properties above). This can be used to traverse or model the Org Structure as a whole.
Users do not have to be enrolled in an org unit to see details of that org unit. Any enrollment in the organization is sufficient to grant access to any of its descendants' details.
Implicit access to the Org Structure is read-only. Users are not implicitly given access to modify the Org Structure, or any details of any of the org units within it.
Although the user has implicit read-only access to the Org Structure in this way, the Brightspace user experience, including API endpoints, may still restrict this access further, for example by hiding org unit details where the user has no enrollments.
Permissions granted in a different organization within the same instance are not considered. That is, a user logged into organization A will not necessarily be granted access to the Org Structure of organization B on the same instance.
Unauthorized Access
If a user tries to access an org unit in which they are not enrolled, they will receive a Not Authorized error message. Similarly, if a user tries to access an org unit in a role which does not grant them access permissions to the page, they will also receive a Not Authorized error message.

About Org Unit Editor

Use the Org Unit Editor to view, edit, and create org units within your organizational structure. You can also use it to search for org units by type, search for orphan or childless org units, restore deleted org units, and delete org units. Org units define the structure of an institution. 
 For more information about Org Structures and Org Units, refer to Org Structures in Brightspace.
Each org unit is an instance of a particular org unit type. For example, Fall 2022 and Winter 2022 could be separate org units of the org unit type semester.
When creating course offering and course section codes, D2L recommends the following naming conventions:
Course offering - <DEPT_ORG_SEMESTER>
Course sections - <DEPT_ORG_SEMESTER_SECTIONVALUE>
These recommended naming conventions will foster effective reporting (to aggregate data based on codes) and searching of features.
Some examples are as follows:
Example: Math course

Org unit terms
Term
Definition

Parent Org Unit


The top-level or parent org unit is a level above another org unit in your organizational hierarchy. A parent can have many children. For example, a course template org unit can be the parent of many child course offerings.


Child Org Unit


Sub-levels of an org unit. Some children can have several parents. For example, a course offering is the child of a course template as well as a semester.


Orphaned Org Unit


An org unit not attached to any parent. For example, a course offering that was separated from its associated course template, perhaps because the template was deleted.


Org Unit Type


There are six default org unit types: semester, department, course template, course offering, group, and section. You can add additional org unit types to your hierarchy, change the names of existing org unit types, and change the hierarchy or org units. For example, your organization might also use Colleges and Schools.

Link Orgs in a multi-site arrangement

Using Site Tabs allows separate Orgs to be linked together in a multi-site arrangement. Once the Orgs are linked, administrators can link user accounts across Orgs by populating a Global User ID in the appropriate Orgs using APIs.
This feature is useful to:
Large consortium clients, such as state level implementations that share teaching staff, administration staff, or learners across campuses set up as independent Orgs.
Professional Development for Education clients that want to brand and configure PD sites differently from their main Brightspace implementations.
Organizations with affiliated sites, programs, or schools that share learners and support staff, but operate independently.
Site Tabs help instructors or learners who teach or take courses at more than one Brightspace institution stay on top of their course load. The learner can log into any Brightspace Org that is part of the multi-site arrangement and see tabs for all their Brightspace Orgs across the top of the navbar. Organization announcements, course updates, and homepage content are kept separate for easy processing of information. Navigation to another site is simple and an activity alert on the Site Tab for another organization lets learners and instructors know there is new activity that they may wish to act on.
Individual Orgs retain autonomy in how they brand, configure and permission their site, while learners and instructors benefit from direct calls-to-action and easy access. Site Tabs help keep a Brightspace user's entire course load top of mind.
For additional documentation on Site Tab APIs visit our Valence documentation.
Note: This feature is available as an add-on for all Brightspace packages. Contact your D2L Client Sales Executive for add-on pricing details and to set up an implementation consultation.

About Org Unit Type Editor

The Org Unit Type Editor as a part of the Org Unit  Editor allows you to modify the types of org units used within an organizational structure. Using the Org Unit Type Editor, you can add more org unit types to your hierarchy, change the names of existing org unit types, and change the hierarchy of org units. By default, there are six org unit types: Semester, Department, Course Template, Course Offering, Group, and Section. 
 For more information about each of these default org unit types, refer to Org Structures in Brightspace.
About editing org unit types
If you make changes to default org unit types (except departments), the changes affect all organizations on your instance. If you make changes to a custom org unit type or department the changes affect all org units of that type in your organization. You should have a clear understanding of what your organizational and cross-organizational needs are and how default and standard org unit types are used before you modify org unit types. Consult with your D2L account manager for assistance and direction.
Sample organization hierarchy
A sample organization hierarchy

The sample organization hierarchy diagram shows how the basic org unit types are arranged into a hierarchy. Custom org unit types are normally inserted between departments and the organization. For example, departments might be grouped into faculties, faculties into colleges, and colleges attached directly to the organization.

--------------------------------------------------


Create and delete org unit types

Before you create or modify org unit types, ensure you understand how your organization is structured and determine how you want to maintain that structure within Brightspace and other D2L tools.
Note: Changing your organizational structure can have unexpected consequences and should only be attempted with a very clear understanding of the existing structure and your organizational needs.
Some restrictions apply when creating new org unit types:
Two instances of the same org unit type cannot reside in the same org hierarchy.
You must create a unique org unit code for all departments and semesters.
Departments must be above course templates, which must be above course offerings, which must be above groups and sections.
For example, an organization hierarchy may resemble the following:
Organization > Colleges > Faculties > Departments > Course Templates > Course Offerings > Sections > Groups
It might not be necessary to create an org unit type for each level of the hierarchy, unless specific, individual homepages for each level are required. In the provided example, you might not need to create a college or faculty org unit type; it might be sufficient to have departments. 
When deciding which levels of your hierarchy to create, consider the following:
Reports can be generated that aggregate data on all org units of the same org unit type. For example, a report could be generated for each department that shows how many courses are using the Chat tool.
Users can be enrolled in a cascading role in any org unit; a cascading role automatically enrolls users in all of the org unit’s descendants.
Homepages can be set up for any org unit type.
To create a new org unit type
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Org Unit Editor.
Click Manage Types.Figure: The Manage Types button.
 Click Create Org Unit Type.Figure: The Create Org Unit Type button.
Enter your org unit type details:NameDisplay NameDescriptionFigure: Creating a new Org Unit Type.
Click Create.
Delete an org unit type
Deleting an org unit type changes your organization's hierarchy. You should have a clear understanding of what your organizational needs are and how the default and standard org unit types are used before you modify your organizational hierarchy.
You cannot delete an org unit type while org units of that type exist.
You cannot delete the course template, course offering, group, section, and department org unit types.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Org Unit  Editor.
From the context menu of the org unit type you want to delete, click Delete.Figure: Deleting an Org Unit Type.

About the course homepage

The homepage is the first page you see when you view the organization's My Home page or enter a course. The typical default homepage is widget-based. Widgets are sections of content that provide information and links to tools, courses, and personal settings. Organization and course homepages can point to Brightspace tools, such as Announcements or Content, or an external URL.
Widgets are the building blocks of homepages. You can create, edit, delete, customize, and preview the widgets in your organization.
There are two types of widgets available for your homepages:
System Widgets
Custom Widgets

Style your added widgets by adjusting their properties. 
Click Save and Close.
To make this homepage active for an org unit, select the homepage from the Active Homepage drop-down list and click Apply.
Enforce a default homepage on child org units
Enforcing a homepage prevents instructors from assigning custom homepages to individual courses. This enables you to manage all of your organization’s homepages from a single source; when you update the enforced homepage, all child org unit homepages reflect that change.
Enforcing homepages enables you to create and implement organization-wide branding and content. As a result, learners and instructors experience consistent organization-wide homepages for courses and consistent navigation that focuses on branding, color, and discoverability.
On the My Home page, click  Course Admin >  Homepages.
From the context menu of the homepage you want to enforce for all child org units, click  Force Homepage. This option is only available for the homepage you've set as default.
Click Enforce.
If you click  Don’t Force Homepage from the context menu of the enforced homepage, the default homepage for all child org units returns to the course default.

It is possible to add a course image banner below the navigation bar on widget-based homepages for courses (and other org units, such as departments, in the Brightspace Daylight Experience). The banner provides a venue to personalize the look and feel of  homepages and provide a connection between the course tile in the My Courses widget and the  homepage.
Administrators control the prominence of this feature in the Brightspace Daylight Experience. If the feature is turned on, the banner appears at the top of the course homepage by default. If you have the appropriate permissions, you can change or remove the course banner using the Options menu on the banner, the Edit Homepage menu at the bottom of the homepage, or  the Homepage Banner setting on the Course Offering Information page.
Create a tool-based homepage

You can use a replace string to populate an external URL for an org unit. If you configure a homepage URL as follows: https://www.bing.com/search?q={OrgUnitId}, the replace string is populated with the users current OrgUnitId when the homepage is accessed.
Set a default homepage
Each org unit must have a homepage. You can set up a default homepage for your organization that you can apply to any org unit that does not use a custom homepage. The homepage you set as the default at the organization level becomes the default homepage for all new course offerings. If you update the default at the organization level, any courses using the default homepages will also change.
On the My Home page, click  Course Admin >  Homepages.
From the context menu of the homepage you want to set as a course default, click Make Default.
Updating the default settings across all homepages that use a widget
On the Admin Tools > Homepage Management page, select Widgets.
Select the Custom Widgets tab or System Widgets tab.
Click Customize for the selected widget and make the required changes.

About the My Courses widget

The My Courses widget enables learners to access their favorite courses by pinning them to the top of their course list. In the mobile view, widgets now stack on top of each other, and the My Courses widget offers many new options to instructors.
With this widget, instructors and learners see courses by enrollment date, prioritizing current enrollments. Administrators and power users see courses by the last accessed date. If there are less than 50 total enrollments, they are sorted as follows:
The My Courses widget shows manually pinned courses in the Pinned tab. In the All tab,  pinned courses appear first, followed by current enrollments, then future enrollments (if they are available or visible to the user) for a total of 12 enrollments. Note that more than 12 courses might appear if they are all manually pinned. Pinned course tiles display notifications for unevaluated assignment submissions and quizzes, and unread discussion posts. 
The Course Selector drop-down menu shows manually pinned courses, followed by current enrollments, then future enrollments (if they are available and visible to the user), and finally, past enrollments (if they are visible to the user).
The View All Courses navigation drills down into the courses by showing manually pinned courses, followed by current enrollments, then future enrollments (if available and visible to the user), then past enrollments (if available or visible to the user) as the default sort. If the user changes the sort order, the filter does not separate pinned courses from other courses based on sort order, filters, and search terms.
If there are more than 50 total enrollments, they are sorted as follows:
The My Courses widget shows manually pinned courses in the Pinned tab. In the All tab,  manually pinned courses are followed by up to 12 last-accessed courses. Note that more than 12 courses might appear in the widget if they are all manually pinned.
The Course Selector drop-down menu shows manually pinned courses, followed by up to 12 last-accessed courses, followed by all remaining courses available to the user.
The View all Courses area shows manually pinned courses followed by up to 12 last-accessed courses, followed by all remaining courses available or visible to the user as the sort order. If the user changes the sort order, the filter does not separate pinned courses from other courses based on the sort order, filters, and search terms.
Additionally, you can use the Customize this Widget option to configure the My Courses widget to display tabs that organize courses by Semester Name, Department, or Role for the Org. You can choose to sort the Semester Name and Department tabs alphabetically or reverse-alphabetically. Users can easily view all their courses by clinking through each tab. 
Note: Information displayed on course tiles in the My Courses Widget is cached by a user's browser session and that cache is updated every five minutes. This ensures that the widget remains performant, as data on the widget changes infrequently. This may mean that changes to information displayed on course tiles may take up to five minutes to display a change. Some examples of areas affected include the active state of a course offering, the image in the course card, and the name or code of a course offering. Enrollments are not affected by caching and any new enrollments into course offerings will appear in the My Courses Widget immediately.

Any images that you include with the My Courses widget are available to include in the course components that you export, copy, or import.
Before uploading logo or course images, consider the following recommendations:
For logo images used on navbars, ensure that your image is a maximum size of 260 pixels by 60 pixels, and saved as SVG filetype.
For course images, it is recommended that images are 2400 pixels by 960 pixels. Keep in mind that the display height and width of these images may vary in different tools and on different screens and devices. Ensure that any images that you are using appear correctly at different sizes and crop points on laptop, tablet, and mobile device screens.
Note: To maintain security, ensure any .jpg images are clear of EXIF (exchangeable image file) data.
To change the default image
Navigate to your homepage by doing one of the following:If your My Courses widget appears on the My Home page, click the My Home button. If your My Courses widget appears somewhere else, navigate to the location of the widget.
Hover over the course image and click the More Options menu. If you are using assistive technology or keyboard-only navigation, press Tab to access the More Options button and press Enter to view the menu items.

Enable the Work To Do widget

The  Work To Do widget provides learners with a summary of assigned learning activities from all their courses that are overdue or have an upcoming due date or end date. You can add the widget to your organization homepage to aggregate data from all courses, and to course homepages to show only due and overdue learning activities from the course.
The Work To Do widget displays the following learning activities:

Assignments


Checklists


Content


Courses


Discussions


Surveys


Quizzes

By default, it displays overdue items from the past twelve weeks and upcoming items in the next two weeks, with a maximum of 10 weeks . These time ranges can be customized for an org with the following config variables:

d2l.Tools.WorkToDo.OverdueWeekLimit manages the number of weeks to display overdue items up to a maximum of 52 weeks.


d2l.Tools.WorkToDo.UpcomingWeekLimit manages the number of weeks to display upcoming items to a maximum of 10 weeks.

Regardless of the time range, the widget will display a maximum of 6 items. If additional items are available, they can be seen in the full-screen view by clicking the View all work button. On this page, all items with due/end dates for the upcoming year can be seen.
Note: If you want to extend or limit the time ranges for upcoming or overdue work for the widget, contact D2L.  D2L Support can edit these properties for your organization.

About My Org Units widget

About My Org Units widget
Normally, organization administrators are the only users at an institution who can view and navigate to all org unit types through the Org Unit Editor tool found in the Admin Tools menu. Instructors and learners cannot easily navigate to org unit types other than course offering org units they are enrolled in, which are listed in the course selector on the minibar and in the My Courses widget.
My Org Units is a custom widget that allows all users to search and navigate to different types of org units they are enrolled in such as colleges, departments, semesters, groups, sections, course offerings, and course templates. This widget allows instructors and learners to go to other org units aside from their enrolled course offerings, bypassing the need to have access to the Org Unit Editor.
Enabling the My Org Units widget

Customize the login page

Use the Login Page Management tool to customize the login page for your organization.
Administrators can create a single sign-on option on their Brightspace login page. The Login Page Management tool provides the ability to add single sign on buttons within the Login Widget based on registered SAML identity providers. Using this feature reduces the complexity of creating a single sign-on link or button and removes the dependency on having to modify the HTML code underpinning the login page.
The Manage Single Sign-On Buttons permission enables the visibility of the Single Sign-on Buttons card within the Login Page Management Admin tool. After the permission has been granted, the Display Single Sign-On Button settings appear under the Advanced Settings area.

Figure: Display Single Sign-on Buttons area of Login Page Management.
The Display Options button enables you to configure the button settings including the text, button color, text color, the Identity Provider and Button URL, and Login Page visibility.

Figure: Display Options for the Single Sign-on button.
Note: If the Identity Provider was registered using the client self-serve version of SAML Administration, the Button preview displays the SAML Identity Display Name provided when you registered the Identity Provider. If it wasn't registered using the client self-serve version, it displays the Identity Provider Entity ID. If there are more than one Identity providers registered, the Display Single Sign-on Button area displays them. You can change the order to reflect how you want the list to appear on Login page.

Figure: Multiple registered Identity Providers for Single Sign-on.
Note: If there is no Identity Provider, the Display Single Sign-On Buttons option does not appear.
Shorten an organization's local login page URL
Administrators can use a shortened URL to access an organization’s learning platform from the local login page. The shortened web URL uses the following syntax: https://{hostname}/d2l/local.
The shortened web URL maps to the longer version of the URL, https://{hostname}/d2l/login?noredirect=1, and is available for all environments.

Customizable login page elements

To reflect your organization's branding and improve the usability of the login widget for users, you can configure the following from the Login Page Management tool:
Headline
Use the headline to include a short introductory sentence and the name of your organization at the top of the login page.You can also customize the color of the headline. By default, black (#000000) is the headline color.
Background Color
To reflect your organization's branding more, you can specify a background color for the login page. By default, the background color is transparent. To ensure that users can read all text on the login page, D2L recommends changing the default transparent background to a specific color.To ensure Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AA compliance, the headline color picker and background color picker are linked. An icon and tooltip message in each color picker informs you if the color choices meet WCAG AA standards.If you select the transparent background, the colors specified in the page theme display in the login page.
Message
The message displays below the headline. Use it to provide your users with additional information they may require.
Picture Widget
You can include one or more images to display in a widget beside the login area. If you include more than one image, the login page randomly selects an image to display in the widget each time a user accesses it. You can include a border around images.
Additional Content
Optionally, you can display content below the local login widget, above the footer. For example, you can include important information users should know before logging in. By default, the message box is empty.
Advanced Settings:

Figure: Advanced Settings area of Login Page Management.
Navbar
The navbar displays at the top of the login page, above the headline. You can customize the navbar's appearance, or use your organization's default navbar. Unlike the navbar that displays once you log in to Brightspace, the login page navbar displays without icons or links to tools.
Local Login Form Display
You can choose to always expand, collapse, or hide the local login widget. By default, the login widget is expanded. 
Center the login and picture widgets horizontally
You can choose to center the local login and picture widgets horizontally. By default, the widgets are left aligned.                   
Do not include a forgot password link
You can choose to remove the Forgot your password? link in the login area of the login page. Users can click the link if they need to reset their password.
Prevent search engines from indexing pages for this site
You can choose to prevent search engines from indexing pages for your site. Turning this setting on adds a robots meta tag to D2L pages on your site.
Logout Destination
You can choose a custom logout destination for users who are authenticated against the LE (who used LPM or a local login page to login). Users who logged in using an SSO solution still log out to the value configured in the SSO settings.The new logout destination does not take effect until after a user’s next log in.
Note: If your organization has more than one active locale option, the login page displays a language selector that allows users to set one of the available languages as their default language for the login page. This language setting only applies to the login page. Changing the language does not change any custom text appearing on that page.

Language Management glossary

The following table indicates the terms used in the Language Management tool.

Term


Definition


Tool package


A group of language terms that are used in the same tool


Collection


A group of language terms that are used on the same page or for similar functionality


Parent language


The parent language determines which language the system defaults to when a term from a language pack has no translation value. If you create a language pack based on a default language, the parent language is the language from which you translate terms.





--------------------------------------------------


Customize language terms

Use the Manage Languages tool to customize Brightspace to suit the specific language needs of your organization. 
The Manage Languages tool enables you to: 
Edit system language packs (available in Arabic, Spanish (Latin America and Castilian), Brazilian Portuguese, French (Canada and France), Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Swedish, German, Danish, Dutch, Turkish, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Welsh, and English (US, UK and Canada) provided by D2L to reflect your organization’s unique branding for tools and features. Please contact your account manager for more information on availability of language packages and pricing.
Create custom language packs tailored to specific audiences or learning capabilities. 
D2L strives to continuously improve the quality of Brightspace through new tools and tool enhancements. As a result, language terms are created, removed, and deprecated with any given release. Maintenance of language packs is an ongoing process. 
Changes to language packs only apply to the organization you make them in. Therefore, you can maintain separate language changes (branding) for multiple organizations on the same instance. Your changes are maintained between upgrades. 
Note: D2L recommends that you avoid using HTML, SGML, or any other markup language to format language terms except where such formatting already exists in the default language pack supplied by D2L.
Brackets are used in language terms to reference variables. Do not delete them or change the content inside them. For example, “Delete the category [0].”
To customize language terms
From the Admin Tools menu, click Language Management.
Click the language you want to customize.
To generate a list of language terms, do any of the following:Use the search bar to find a term you want to edit. To generate a list of all terms, leave the field blank. Note: D2L recommends using this field when searching for language terms across Brightspace.Figure: Find a term for editing.From the Tool Package drop-down list, select the package containing the terms you want to customize. To change the language term across all tools, leave the - All Tool Packages - default option. From the Collection drop-down list, select the collection containing the terms you want to customize.

Import or export a language pack

About importing language packs
Creating custom language packs enables you to change the language used in Brightspace to reflect your organization's branding or terminology. You can also create custom language packs to translate Brightspace into other languages or dialects.
When you create a language pack, you must select whether it has a parent language in order to determine which language the system defaults to when a language term has no translation value. If you create a language pack based on a default language, the parent language is the language from which you translate terms. If you do not select a parent language during import, missing translation terms default to the system's native language.
D2L strongly recommends that you create new language packs based on a parent language and edit them using the Manage Languages tool.
If you need to import a language pack, it must be a .zip file containing .xml files that follow a specific format. Use the sample language file on the Import Languages page or export an existing language pack to ensure you meet our requirements.
Import a language pack 
If you want to have a backup of your previous terms, instead of replacing an existing language pack, create a new language pack with the same name and set the older version to inactive. Custom terms in the import packages retain custom value designation. As a result, you can differentiate between custom overrides and values that were part of the original language pack. Imported terms replace any previously existing custom values. If there was no previous custom value, the terms are added as new custom values. The default value column in the user interface contains the parent language default value.
In the organization you want to import a language pack for, from the Admin Tools menu, click Language Management > Import Languages.
In the Import File area, click Browse. Locate your .xml file. Click Open.
In the Import Action area, do one of the following:To replace an existing language pack with the file you are importing, select Update existing language. From the Language to Update drop-down list, select the language pack you want to replace.To create a new language pack with the file you are importing, select Create new language. In the Name field, enter your language's name. From the Parent Language drop-down list, select the parent language for the language pack.
Click Import.
About exporting a language pack
Language packs are exported as .zip files containing .xml files for each of the tool packages. It is also possible for the zip file for new language packs to contain only updated (custom) terms within each XML file. The .xml files should follow these conditions:
Only change the default value text. If you change other information, such as the tool, package, collection, or term name, the system will not know where to use the term.
Do not change the names of .xml files
Do not format text
Do not add language terms
To avoid the risk of creating errors in the .xml files, D2L suggests editing language packs using the Language Management tool.
Export a language pack
It is possible to export all terms in a language pack, a selection of terms based on selected search terms, or the updated (custom) terms within each XML file. 
Custom terms in the packages no longer become new default values; rather they retain custom value designation. As a result, you can differentiate between custom overrides and values that were part of the original language pack. Small language packs that contain only the custom language terms can help mitigate the disruptive impact of importing and exporting language packs.
Depending on the type of lang terms you want to export, you follow a different process.
In the organization where you want to export a language pack, from the Admin Tools menu, click Language Management.
Click the Export Language icon for the language pack you want to download.
Do one of the following: To export all terms, in the Export Language dialog, click the link for your .zip file. Then, save the .zip file to your computer.To export terms with custom values, click Export Custom Values. To export specific terms, enter a search term in the search field. Select the search parameters, tool package, and collection you want to export and click. Select the terms you want to include in the export package. Click Export.

Set a default locale

Setting the default locale within the Manage Locales tool determines the default locale for the entire organization. If a course or user's locale preferences are not set, the system uses the default locale.
You can only have one default locale at any given time. It should be the locale that best reflects the needs of your users and organization. You cannot delete the default locale.
A locale must be active before you can set it as default. 
Do one of the following:
To set the default locale for the organization, from the Admin Tools menu, click Locale Management. From the context menu of the locale you want to set, click Set as Default.
To set the default locale for a course, in the course offering, click Course Admin > Course Offering Information. From the Locale drop-down list, select your locale. If you want to override users' set locales, select Override locale preferences. Click Save.

It is possible to force a locale at the organization level by setting the following configuration variables:
d2l.Region.ForceLocale – Set this variable to the locale you want to force.
d2l.Region.PreferredOrgUnitLocale – If you enable this configuration variable, the organization uses the locale defined in d2l.Region.PreferredOrgUnitLocale, regardless of user and course offering settings.
Forcing a locale at the organization level disables users' ability to set personal locale preferences to suit their needs. Alternatively, if you want to limit locale options, we recommend deactivating locales you do not want in your organization. 



--------------------------------------------------


Edit the status of a locale

Locales that are set to active are available to everyone; they can be applied to course offerings and set within a user's preferences. If you want to make a locale unavailable to your organization, you can change its status to inactive. Changing its status to inactive allows you to use it again in the future.
Deactivating a locale removes that locale as an option for courses and users; the system prompts you to select a replacement locale for those courses or users that might have the deactivated locale in use.
To edit the status of a locale
From the Admin Tools menu, click Locale Management.
Do one of the following:To set a locale as active, from the inactive locale's context menu, click Set Active.To set a locale as inactive, from the active locale's context menu, click Set Inactive. Select a replacement locale.Figure:  Setting a locale as inactive from the active locale's context menu.

Add a location to a layout

You can use the Locations tool to define the location name, building, and room dimensions to represent real rooms within your institution.
Use the Seating Chart's drag-and-drop interface to view and track attendance and participation for your course and group events. Seating Chart enables you to assign students to seats representative of your classroom and track student performance on a session-by-session basis.
Note: Seating Chart integrates with both the Locations and Calendar tools. Because seating charts depend on locations, you must first create or activate a location with a layout before creating any seating charts.
To add layouts to locations
From the Admin Tools menu, click Locations.
On the Locations page, click the location that you want to add a layout to.Figure: Choosing a location for adding a layout.Locations with existing layouts display a Seating Chart icon beside the location name. You can pause on this icon to view seating capacity details.

About Metadata

Metadata is information about a learning resource that you add to the resource to help other users locate it and understand its purpose. 
Administrators can create views, templates, and taxon schemas for your organization to enable users to enter repetitive metadata information quickly and consistently. 
You can add and edit metadata for content modules and topics when you publish them to Brightspace Learning Repository. You can also add metadata to content modules and topics from directly within the Content tool.
Metadata and the Brightspace Learning Repository tool
You can search for learning resources (objects and files) based on their metadata from within a Brightspace Learning Repository (LOR), and you can view an object’s metadata to determine whether it suits your needs before you import it into a course. Depending on your permissions, you can also edit the learning object’s metadata. Organizations can also require adding metadata when publishing a learning object to an LOR and can specify a set of required metadata that is mandatory for learning objects. 
Metadata interfaces
There are two interfaces that you can use to enter metadata:
Basic interface - The basic interface presents a simple list of fields grouped into categories. Users cannot specify a language for their values or enter values in multiple languages, nor can they add additional values to a field (although they can configure a view to display a field multiple times in the basic interface, enabling users to enter multiple values).
Advanced interface - The advanced interface enables users to specify their language, enter values in multiple languages, and enter multiple values for some fields. If a view is part of the IEEE LOM family, its fields display as a hierarchy in the advanced editor.
Best practices for using metadata
If you want to only see category names instead of all of the fields in every category, enable the basic interface. If you choose to only display the category names, you can still show the fields in the first category by default.
If you want to use a template, import metadata, or copy metadata from another resource, do so before manually entering data. Any data you enter manually is erased when you apply existing metadata from another source. 
In some fields, you may need to enter more than one value; for example, if a resource has multiple keywords or multiple authors/contributors. In the basic interface, if a field accepts multiple values, it is listed multiple times. In the advanced interface, you can manually add additional values to a field and then enter data for the additional values. Each value can have multiple translations in different languages. 
If another resource in your course has similar metadata, you can copy that resource’s metadata and then modify it, rather than re-entering all of the information.
Views within the same family provide different ways of looking at (or entering) the same metadata, but views in different families provide access to different metadata. Keep this in mind when you determine what views to make available to users in your organization.
Switching views can lead to conflicts and will cause you to lose unsaved changes. Avoid switching views where possible.
Use a standard naming convention for templates in your organization.
Use replace strings to add dynamic information to a template. 
If you want to specify the language of your metadata and enter data for a single field in multiple languages, use the advanced interface.
Troubleshooting metadata conflicts
Conflicts occur when a resource’s metadata violates restrictions set by the current view. You might encounter a conflict when you:
Switch between views
Switch from the advanced interface to the basic interface
Apply a template
Import metadata

Conflict


Reason


Result


Resolution


Character Limit


The value of the data exceeds the character limit set for the field


The value truncates


Use a shorter value or cancel your changes and use the advanced interface or an alternate view


Vocabulary


The value of the data does not belong to the restricted vocabulary set for the field


The value clears


Select a value from the field’s restricted vocabulary or cancel your changes and use the advanced interface or an alternate view


Multiplicity


A field contains more values than the view allows


Additional values save but do not display


Use the advanced interface or an alternate view if you want to see or edit the additional values


Language


Occurs when you import data in a language not used by the Metadata tool in your organization


The language changes to “unspecified”

Select an alternate language, leave the language unspecified, or ask site administration to add the language




--------------------------------------------------


Using metadata views

Metadata views
A view is a collection of fields. A field corresponds to one piece of data that you enter as part of a metadata object. For example, title, description, author, date created, and rights are all possible fields. Different views enable users to see and modify different fields when looking at metadata.
Brightspace includes six base metadata views that implement widely used metadata standards:
Dublin Core (http://dublincore.org/documents/) - This view categorizes metadata using 15 different elements: contributor, coverage, creator, date, description, format, identifier, language, publisher, relation, rights, source, subject, title, and type.
GEM - This view categorizes metadata using 9 different elements: general, life cycle, meta-metadata, technical, educational, rights, relation, annotation, and classification.
IEEE LOM - This view categorizes metadata using the 15 Dublin Core elements, plus 7 additional elements: audience, cataloging, duration, essential resources, pedagogy, quality, and standard.
Normetic (http://www.normetic.org/ (French) or http://www.normetic.org/-English-.html (English)) - This view is a French version you can use to categorize metadata based on the IEEE LOM view.
Object Publishing - This view categorizes metadata based on a simplified Dublin Core view using 3 different elements: title, description, and keywords.
Object Publishing IEEE LOM - This view categorizes metadata based on a simplified IEEE LOM view using 3 different elements: title, description, and keywords.
Default system views refer to any of the views that ship with Brightspace by default.
Brightspace also includes two default system views that inherit from the IEEE LOM base view:
CanCore (http://cancore.tru.ca/en/)
Asset Metadata
Create a metadata view
Creating a new metadata view may be necessary for any number of reasons. For example, you might require a view for a specific department to refine the general organization’s view, or a simplified view for users who do not require access to all of the metadata associated with your organization’s resources.
You can create new views based on any of the available views, including views you have previously created. When creating a new view, you can rename, reorganize, and hide fields, change field types, and set data restrictions; however, you cannot add additional fields or radically alter the structure of the base view.
Some of the fields in IEEE LOM and Dublin Core are cross-walked, meaning the values from those fields automatically synchronize between the two views. In fields that are not cross-walked, the values entered in a view from one family are not visible across families.
Keep this in mind when you determine what views to make available to users in your organization. Views within the same family provide different ways of looking at (or entering) the same metadata, but views in different families provide access to different metadata.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Metadata Administration.
On the Views page, click New View.
Enter a View Name.
From the Parent View drop-down list, select the parent view that contains the structure that you want your view to inherit.
Do one of the following:If you want your view to inherit its settings from its parent, select Inherit Properties from Parent View.If you want your view to copy properties from an existing view, select Copy Properties from an Existing View.
Click Save.
On the Edit View page, using the provided tabs, further customize your General, Restrictions, and Layout options.
Click Save.
Import a metadata view
You can add a metadata view by importing an XML file into Brightspace.
Brightspace treats any view that you import as a customized view and maintains the language terms defined in the org unit that the view comes from. For example, if a French org defines a view with French terms and exports the view, then when you import the view in another org unit, users see the French terms even if they are using English.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Metadata Administration.
On the Views page, from the More Actions button, click Import View.
On the Import View page, enter a View Name.
To select the view that you want to import, click Browse. Locate your file and click Open.
Click Import.
Export a metadata view
You can export a metadata view as an XML file. When you export a metadata view, it retains the language terms that you have in your org unit. For example, your French org defines a view with French terms and exports the view, then when other users import the view in another org unit, they see the French terms even if they are using English.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Metadata Administration.
On the Views page, from the More Actions button, click Export View.
From the Export View drop-down list, select the view you want to export.
Click Export.




--------------------------------------------------


Using metadata languages

Set initial metadata language
The initial language serves two purposes: All the metadata you enter through the basic interface is associated with the initial language and the initial language is selected by default for values entered through the advanced interface.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Metadata Administration.
On the Metadata Languages page, in the Actions column for the language you want to set as default, click the Set Initial Language icon.
Add a metadata language
You can add a language for users in metadata fields. This enables users, when publishing a content topic, to enter multiple descriptions for the topic in different languages. For each language variant, users specify the language they use from the choices available.
From the Admin Tools, click Metadata Administration.
On the Metadata Languages page, from the Select a Language drop-down list, click the language you want to add.
If you want to identify regional variations for your chosen language, from the Select a Country drop-down list, click the country you want to add.
Click Add.

Form Elements

Brightspace uses system-defined form items to gather data from users through its pages and forms. The Form Elements tool lists forms that group form items for use in specific Brightspace tools.
Form items can be fields, drop-down lists, check boxes, and other data types. Some form items are reusable across tools and can be accessed by users. For example, the UserProfile form includes form items that an Instructor with appropriate permissions can add as System Fields to new form templates at the organization and course level.
Administering Form Elements
If you have the necessary permissions, you can use the Form Elements tool to view and change properties of system-defined forms and form items. You cannot edit top-level Form Elements in the treeview to change the names of or disable Brightspace tools that integrate with Form Elements. You can edit the labels, values, and display order of some form items.

Configure Learning Tool Interoperability (Legacy LTI 1.1) support

Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a proposed standard for passing user, organization, and course information between learning management systems (tool consumers) and learning tools and tool providers, such as wikis, simulations, assessment tools, protected content, and so on.
Brightspace supports LTI 1.0 and 1.1. This support entails:
Management interfaces to define integrations with external learning tools (tool providers) and to create links.
New Quicklink type to allow links to tool providers to be easily incorporated throughout Brightspace courses.
Links to external learning tools that can send user, organization, and course context information for a personalized experience in the tool. Single sign-on to learning tools is supported through an OAuth framework using a key/secret shared between the external learning tool and the configured link in Brightspace.
Management tools to configure mapping from Brightspace roles to IMS roles, and from Brightspace org unit types to IMS context types.To adhere to the LTI specification, Brightspace provides the full URN value in the "roles" field within LTI launch data, along with the short name. For example, the LTI Roles value for Learner is delivered as the following:<input type="hidden" name="roles" value ="urn:lti:instrole:ims/lis/Learner,Learner">D2L strongly advises clients, when configuring their D2L Role--IMS Role mapping (in the IMS Configuration settings tool), to only map their local D2L roles to the "handles" that appear in both the LIS Institution Role and LIS Context Role vocabularies: this will afford maximum portability when integrating with properly conforming Tool Provider applications and services.
You must enable LTI functionality at the organization (administrative) level before configuring tool providers at the organization or org unit level. This includes defining LTI permissions, mapping IMS roles and org units to the roles and org units at your organization, and setting default org level tool consumer information.

Add any custom parameters required by the tool provider by entering a name and the associated value in the available fields.
To manage security settings at the link level, select the Use link security settings default, and select the tool consumer, context, and user information required by the tool provider.
To use the security settings you set at the tool provider level, select the Use tool provider security settings default.With Use tool provider security settings enabled, you do not need to manage security settings for each individual link. This is useful when importing multiple LTI links from a common cartridge package. When you import LTI links, they automatically default to the Use tool provider security settings option. To override this setting, select the Use link security settings default.
Click Save.
From the drop-down list beside the newly created link, select Preview link to launch the link with the current user and context information.
From the same drop-down list, select   Preview Request Details to inspect the information that is sent to the tool provider for troubleshooting.
Create a Quicklink to a tool provider link
You can create new content topics that are Quicklinks to tool provider links, and you can create a Quicklink from any page that uses the Brightspace Editor.
In Brightspace Editor, click the  Insert Quicklink icon.
From the Type drop-down list, select External Learning Tools. 
From the External Learning Tools drop-down list, select the name of the link.

Set up integration with a tool provider

The LTI service, Content-Item Message (1.0), allows instructors to insert third party content into Brightspace once you have created the standard integration for that third party tool using the existing remote plugin work flow. 
Similar to configuring tool providers at the org level, configuring tool providers at the org unit level has the following differences:
The tool provider integration is only available from the org unit in which you configure the integration, and any children of that org unit in your organizational hierarchy.
When setting up integration with a tool provider from an org unit, the External Learning Tools Areas menu includes a Configure Context Information area instead of the Configure Tool Consumer Information area. This area is used to define information about the org unit.
From the  Admin Tools menu, click External Learning Tools.
Click the Manage Tool Providers tab.
Click New Tool Provider.
In the Launch Point field, enter the base URL supplied by the tool provider (do not include http://).
In the Version field, choose a version. There are various versions of LTI, each with a range of capabilities. For details on functionality, refer to the LTI version chart.
In the OAuth Signature Method field, specify the cryptographic hash function. HMAC-SHA256 is the default value. Note: If a link does not domain match to a tool provider, HMAC-SHA1 is specified instead of the default HMAC-SHA256 value. If the tool requires HMAC-SHA256, you must create a tool provider using HMAC-SHA256.
In the Secret field, enter the secret supplied by the tool provider.
To use a key that is not your default key, check the Use custom tool consumer information instead of default check box and update the appropriate fields. Use this option if the key from the tool provider is not your default key, or you want the tool provider to access different information than you usually share with other tool providers.
To manage security settings at the tool provider level rather than for each individual link, under Security Settings, select the tool consumer, context, and user information required by the tool provider. 
Click Save.

LTI 1.1/1.0 Security Settings

The checkbox fields on the Tool Consumer screen determine if specific Security Settings appear when a user creates or edits an External Learning Tool link. Each security setting is responsible for sending specific context data at the time of launch. 
Allow sending tool consumer information to tool provider determines if the tool_consumer variables are allowed to be included in an LTI launch. 
Allow sending context information to tool provider determines if context variables are included in the LTI launch. This specifically effects the context_id, context_title, context_label, and context_type variables.  
Allow sending course information to tool provider determines if course context information can be included in the launch. These are lis_course_offering_sourcedid and lis_course_section_sourcedid. Note: section will be the same value as lis_course_offering_sourcedid.
Allow sending User ID to the tool provider determines if the current user's obfuscated user_id value is included in the LTI launch. If the User_Id is included, Brightspace generates a unique guid value which is sent as the user_id. This guid value is consistent for every launch performed by a specific user, but provides no means for an external party to determine who the user. 
Allow sending user name to tool provider determines if the user's name values are allowed within an LTI post. These values are populated with the user's First Name and Last Name as entered in their Brightspace User profile.
Allow sending user email to tool provider determines if the email field is available to be included in the LTI launch. This value is populated from the email property of the current user's email property.
Allow sending system username to tool provider determines if the username field is available to be included in the LTI launch.
Allow sending system Org Defined ID to tool provider determines if the OrgDefinedId field is available to be included in the LTI launch.This field is not a standard LTI field. It is populated with the current user's OrgDefinedId property. 
Allow sending system role to tool provider determines if the custom D2L role field is available to be included in the LTI launch. This is not a standard LTI role field. It is populated with the name of the Role the user has within the context of the org unit from which the LTI launch occurs. This is different from the standard roles field which always contain a valid LTI role value.
Allow sending link title to tool provider determines if the name of the External Learning Tool Link is included in the LTI launch.  
Allow sending link description to tool provider determines if the description within the External Learning Tool Link is included in the LTI launch.
 Allow sending section code to tool provider determines if course section code can be included in the launch. This is the lis_course_section_sourcedid. Note: if not checked, but Allow sending Course Information is allowed then the section is sent with the same value as lis_course_offering_sourcedid. When the setting is checked, any launch that is associated with that link/tool acts in the following way:If no sections exist:    send lis_course_section_sourcedid = lis_course_offering_sourcedidIf one section exists:    check user enrollment        if enrolled in section            send lis_course_section_sourcedid = section course offering code        if not enrolled in section            send lis_course_section_sourcedid = lis_course_offering_sourcediIf more than one section exists:
    check user enrollment        if enrolled in one section            send lis_course_section_sourcedid = section course offering codeif not enrolled in any section            send lis_course_section_sourcedid = lis_course_offering_sourcedid        if enrolled in multiple sections            send lis_course_section_sourcedid = section course offering code for first enrollment                 based on section name - alphabetical

Understanding LTI Custom Parameter Substitute Variables

The LTI service, Content-Item Message (1.0), allows instructors to insert third party content into Brightspace once you have created the standard integration for that third party tool using the existing remote plugin work flow. 
Custom parameter substitution variables allow specific values to be dynamically substituted for custom parameters requested by a third-party tool. These values are defined by the LTI 1.1.1 standard specification. This data is used to support features of third-party tools. Some third-party tool providers require substitution variables to support feature functionality, or offer enhanced features that use substitution variables.
For example, providing a third-party tool with the actual start and end dates of a course and the user email address of its learners (where both are custom parameters being substituted by substitution variables) could allow the tool to send users a reminder about a task coming due (if that is a feature the tool provides).
D2L supports the following custom parameter substitution variables:
$User.id
$User.username
$Person.email.primary
$Person.name.full
$Person.name.family
$Person.name.given
$ResourceLink.title
$ResourceLink.description
$CourseTemplate.sourcedId
$CourseTemplate.title
$CourseOffering.sourcedId
$CourseOffering.title
$CourseSection.label
$CourseSection.sourcedId
$CourseSection.title
$CourseSection.dept
$CourseSection.timeFrame.begin
$CourseSection.timeFrame.end
$Context.id.history
$ResourceLink.id.history
Ensure the configuration variable d2l.Tools.Lti.CustomParamSubstitution.IsEnabled is set to true to allow users to add third-party tools that require custom parameter substitution variables.



--------------------------------------------------


Understanding Remote Plugin Services

Remote Plugins use the LTI standard connection framework to integrate with third-party services or tool providers to add additional media-rich function to the learning management system.
D2L also supports Content-Item Message services. Content-Item message (CIM) is an LTI extension for exchanging content between tool providers and applications. CIM supports a broad range of content types such as static links, embedded images, or other media file types.
Use the Remote Plugins management tool in Brightspace to create and manage Remote Plugin integrations. Currently, the Remote Plugin Service supports these types of integrations:
Course Builder
Insert Stuff Framework (ISF)
Navbar
Quicklink
Widget
D2L supports three types of CIM Remote Plugins:
QuickLink (CIM)
InsertStuff (CIM)
Course Import (CIM)




--------------------------------------------------


Adding a Content-Item Message certified third-party tool

From the  Admin Tools menu, click Remote Plugins.
On the Manage Remote Plugins page, click New Remote Plugin.
From the Plugin Type drop-down list, do one of the following:If you want to add the third-party tool as a source of content when using Insert Quicklink or when creating content topics from Content, select Quicklink (CIM) and specify the dimensions of the dialog box that presents the content available for insertion to the instructor. If you want to add the third-party tool as a source of content when using Insert Stuff, select Insert Stuff (CIM).If you want to make the third-party content provider available to instructors from Course Import in Table of Contents and Import/Export/Copy Components, select Course Import (CIM).
Enter the Name of the tool that is displayed in the Brightspace menus.Note: D2L recommends using a label that instructors will recognize.
Enter the Launch Point URL provided by the third-party tool provider. The URL must include either http:// or https://.
Enter the LTI Key and the LTI Secret provided by the third-party tool provider.
In the OAuth Signature Method field, specify HMAC-SHA1 as the cryptographic hash function. HMAC-SHA256 is the default value.
Enter an optional Description.
Enter an optional Icon URL.
Click Add Org Units and search and insert the org unit(s), in which you want the instructor to see the plugin.Note: If you do not select a specific org unit, the plugin will only be available at the default org unit level.
Click Save.




--------------------------------------------------


Removing a Content-Item Message certified third-party tool

From the  Admin Tools menu, click Remote Plugins.
From the title drop-down menu of the third party tool you want to remove, select Delete. The third party tool is removed from the table on the Manage Remote Plugins page and from the menus it was added to in Brightspace.Note: Content added using the third party tool is not deleted. Any LTIs that were added using the third party tool also remain and must be deleted manually if required.

About SCORM

SCORM stands for Sharable Content Object Reference Model. It is a collection of standards that outlines how online learning materials and learning management systems should interact with one another.
For additional details, visit SCORM Explained 101. If you are using the legacy Brightspace SCORM solution and have Brightspace Learning Repository for your organization, you can save a SCORM object in the LOR and share it out to multiple courses. This allows you to reuse SCORM objects in multiple locations while saving space in each course. Be aware that the LOR does not support publishing SCORM 2004 content directly from your computer.
In order to use the new SCORM solution, you must enable the Content Service for your organization. If you do not enable the Content Service, your organization will continue to use the legacy SCORM solution. If you set up and want to use the new SCORM solution, store SCORM objects directly in Brightspace, and not in Brightspace Learning Repository. You then add SCORM objects directly into the content module you want them to reside in, either by uploading new objects, or selecting from stored objects you had previously uploaded. You can still link objects to multiple courses using dynamic or static linking as you could before, and you can use Import/Export/Copy Components to propagate a part of or a whole course containing SCORM objects to another course in Brightspace.
Brightspace is SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 compliant. SCORM can be used with mobile devices, provided the SCORM object has been developed to work on mobile devices. Access the non-mobile version of your site to make best use of the SCORM object.
For additional technical details about SCORM, visit Technical Overview of SCORM Standard. Because each authoring tool may interpret SCORM standards differently, consider viewing any SCORM-related documentation resources provided by your third party authoring tool.
For an external SCORM testing tool, visit  Scormtester in the Google Code Archive.
Experience API package support
Using the new SCORM solution, instructors can also import and play Experience API (xAPI) packages as SCORM objects in course content. 
Note: xAPI statements are saved to the Content Service; however, currently, the experience data captured in those statements is not accessible from Brightspace.



--------------------------------------------------


Set up the new SCORM solution

As of Brightspace 10.6.11, a new SCORM solution is available. It is turned off by default, but if you turn it on for your organization, it replaces the legacy solution. 
Important: The two SCORM solutions (new and legacy) can be used at the same time in the Brightspace. However, it is not recommended to use both solutions in the same course, as it may cause confusion and be difficult to administer. 
For more information about new and legacy SCORM solutions, see: SCORM: Know Which Player You Are Using.
Turn on the Content Service tool
You must give users access to the Content Service tool.
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Organization Tools.
On the Tool Availability page, set the Availability toggle for Content Service to  (on).
Note: The d2l.Tools.ContentService.Endpoint configuration variable  is auto-configured. 
Set up SCORM permissions
You must grant the appropriate permissions for users to make full use of the new SCORM solution.
Instructors require the following permissions: 
Content Service > Can add new SCORM objects
Content Service > Can view SCORM objects
Content Service > Can view SCORM reports
External Learning Tools > Manage External Learning Tools Links
Learners require the following permission to access SCORM content:
Content Service > Can view SCORM objects 
Map roles in your organization to standard IMS roles
From the  Admin Tools menu, click IMS Configuration.
Do either of the following:To map roles, click the Roles tab. Select the check boxes for the roles you want to map. Ensure that user roles that need to add or upload SCORM content have the IMS role of "Instructor", and roles that need to view content have the IMS role of "Learner".To map org unit types, click the Org Unit Types tab. Select the check boxes for the types you want to map. 
Click Save.
Select the default viewing experience for SCORM objects
Administrators can set the default viewing experience for particular SCORM items when they are selected and uploaded to a course offering. This selection will be the default viewing experience for future SCORM items uploaded to the course.
Navigate to Content.
Select Upload/Create.
Select New SCORM/xAPI Object.
From the ellipses (…) button next to the desired SCORM object, select Edit Properties.
Choose default options in the following fields:Under Configure Course Package Properties, choose one of the following:
Yes, share these files with [desired course]No, keep this file only to myselfUnder Course Package Player Options, choose one of the following:Use embedded player (default)Open player in new windowUnder Course Package Navigation Options, choose one of the following:Use built-in navigation (default)Add navigation controls
Select Save.
Select the desired SCORM item.
Select Next.
Under Course Package Player Options, confirm that your Course Package Player Option default choice is selected.
Click Add.
Administrators are also able to make changes to the Course Package Player Options for SCORM items after they have been uploaded to a course offering.
Navigate to a module.
From the context menu next to the desired SCORM item, select Edit Properties In-place.
Under Course Package Player Options, choose one of the following:
Open player in new window (Default)Use embedded player
Override SCORM grade settings
You can  choose to override SCORM grade object settings to force scores of 0 to the gradebook regardless of the SCORM success state using the configuration variable d2l.Tools.ContentService.AlwaysSubmitZeroGrade. Turning on this configuration variable overrides the SCORM package design to force non-successful SCORM scores to appear in the gradebook as 0. If you choose to not turn on the configuration variable, scores of 0 are only sent when the SCORM object success is set to Failure.  
The d2l.Tools.ContentService.AlwaysSubmitZeroGrade configuration variable is OFF by default. Enabling this configuration variable will only apply for any future attempts per user per SCORM object. Once enabled, the grade override will function on a per user, per SCORM object basis if an incomplete or unsuccessful status is submitted (on the learner's next submission of the SCORM object).
Note: This configuration variable can be set at the Org level if you want all SCORM content in all org units to have a grade of zero submitted without the explicit failed status; alternatively, you can set the configuration variable for specific Org Units as required.

Troubleshoot SCORM

My SCORM objects are too small or too large in the Content tool
In many cases, display issues are the result of settings selected when authoring a SCORM package. If SCORM objects are too small or too large when viewed in Content, consider replacing the absolute values set for the dimensions in the HTML file with relative values. To do this:
From Manage Files, click the action menu for the file you want to edit.
Select Edit File.
Click HTML Source Editor.
Replace the absolute values for width and height in the HTML file with relative values. 
Click Save.
Note: The location of these elements vary depending on the authoring tool used to create the SCORM package. Editing these values from the publishing tool and creating a new package with the updated values allows you to successfully use the package repeatedly while only needing to edit it once.
The top of my SCORM objects are being cropped in the Content tool
The d2l.Tools.Content.ContentIFrameHeight configuration variable can be set to constrain the height of the iframe container so that SCORM objects are not cropped when viewed in Content. 
To set this configuration variable: 
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Config Variable Browser > Tools > Content > ContentIFrameHeight.
Click Add Value.
Enter or select the Org Unit ID for which you want to modify the iframe height.
Enter the new pixel value you want to set for the iframe.
Click Save.
Note: Modifying this configuration variable modifies the height of the iframe container for all content displayed within a given org unit. If you are using other content types in addition to SCORM packages, consider modifying the SCORM package instead.
When I view my SCORM package in the Content tool, I receive a notification that an error occurred initializing communications with the LMS 
Some authoring tools include a multiscreen.html file in SCORM packages that requires editing prior to importing the package into Brightspace. To edit the file:
Open the SCORM package ZIP folder.
Locate the multiscreen.html file.
Open the file in an editor.
Locate the onload parameter of the <frameset> tag.
Replace the current value with: onload="".
Locate the src parameter of the <frame> tag.
Update the src value with the appropriate .htm file. For example, if the project name is VRT – Tool Intro, there should be an htm file in the SCORM package called VRT – Tool Intro.htm. In this example, the src parameter would be: src="VRT – Tool Intro.htm".
Save your changes.
Place the file back in the ZIP folder, overwriting the original.
Import the SCORM package into Brightspace using the Import/Export/Copy Components tool. 
An error appears when I close the window that opened to play my SCORM package
Depending on your authoring tools, and if you are using the legacy SCORM solution, you might have an option to open the player in a new window. Deselect any options that cause the player to open in a new window and export your SCORM object again.
An "LMSSetValueError:cmi.core.lesson_status to [unknown] Incorrect Data Type" error appears when I open my SCORM object
There is an issue with your SCORM object export. The lesson status action is hard-programmed in the export with a value that is not an accepted value option. Open the SCORM package and search for "unknown". If you find it in an .html file, open the file and replace "unknown" with "completed". 



--------------------------------------------------


Publish legacy SCORM objects

Publish a SCORM package as a SWF or HTML5 file with automatic grade creation
If you are using the legacy SCORM solution, to ensure that SCORM packages publish as SWF and HTML5 files with automatic grade creation, the d2l.Tools.Content.AllowAutoSCORMGradeItem configuration variable must be set to On (the default for this variable). This configuration variable is an org unit level variable, allowing you to configure SCORM grade item creation differently across your organization. 
If you are using SCORM 1.2, the user grades are set when the following occurs:
The cmi.core.score.raw value is set
The value for cmi.core.score.max is not null and is greater than zero 
The SCO Terminate call (LMSFinish) is made 
If you encounter errors in your imported SCORM package, test your SCORM package using an external SCORM testing tool such as: https://code.google.com/p/scormtester/. 
Publish a SCORM package as a SWF or HTML5 file with manual grade creation
If you are using the legacy SCORM solution, to ensure that SCORM packages publish as SWF and HTML5 files with manual grade creation, the d2l.Tools.Content.AllowAutoSCORMGradeItem configuration variable must be set to Off for the Org Unit requiring manual grade creation. 
If you are using SCORM 1.2, user grades are set when the following occurs:
The cmi.core.score.raw value is set 
The value for cmi.core.score.max is not null and is greater than zero 
The SCO Terminate call (LMSFinish) is made
These items are set when the SCORM package is authored and are not determined by Brightspace. If you encounter errors in your imported SCORM package, test your SCORM package using an external SCORM testing tool such as: https://code.google.com/p/scormtester/. 



--------------------------------------------------


Create external links

To create external links
External links enable public access to material within the system from outside Brightspace. If a learner clicks an external link from outside the Brightspace, they are first taken to the Brightspace login page. You can create and manage external links the same way as internal links. Only URLs that begins with http/https, ftp/sftp/ftps, file, mailto, feed, itpc, mms, rtsp, or are a relative path beginning with / will be accepted when updating or creating new links.
From the Admin Tools menu, click External Links.
Create categories and links. 
Copy and paste the URL on the External Links Page field on any web page to enable users access to external links.




--------------------------------------------------


Broken Link Viewer

The Broken Link Viewer tool stores a list of broken links found on your site. A broken link error occurs when a browser attempts to access a page or item that does not exist. Link verification is done on text links, images, plug-ins, backgrounds, style sheets, scripts, Java applets, and more. The Broken Link Viewer contains a continuously updated list of URLs.
Note: Although the Broken Link Viewer provides a list of broken links, it does not fix the links.
On the Manage Broken Links page you can see:
The number of broken links in your organization.
Date of last occurrence of a broken link.
URL where the item is supposed to be located (but could not be found).
Identify broken links for a course
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Broken Links. 
Click a course to see its broken links.
Filter broken links
From the Select a date range drop-down list, select one of the following options:Past DayPast 7 DaysCustom Date Range
Click Apply.
Resolve broken links
This process only removes the links from the list. You still need to fix the links manually. If a deleted link is clicked on again before the link is fixed, it reappears in the Broken Link Viewer.
A reoccurring nightly purge task removes broken links that are older than 120 days from the list. Administrators can change the default of 120 days using the d2l.Tools.BrokenLinks.DaysToKeep configuration variable.
Select the check boxes beside the links you want to delete.
Click Delete Selected.

About Email

Administrators can set up and configure how the Email tool works in Brightspace.
Prerequisites for setting up email for your organization
Before you begin setting up your D2L email system you must:

Determine the organization’s domain


Your organization must determine what domain to use for sending and receiving D2L email.
If you are one of many organizations using the same instance of Brightspace your domain value must be unique across the organizations that use the same installation. If you attempt to save a domain value that is not unique you will receive an error message.
Consult your D2L Client Sales Executive if you require guidance.


Allocate storage space for email


If your organization is providing the capability to receive email, the organization must determine how much email storage space to allocate each user. When establishing space allocation, you must consider how much space is available on the file server, as well as limits on message and attachment size.
The amount of storage space that a user is allocated limits the size of all the messages, sent and received, including attachments that the user can store and drafts the user saves. If a user fills 95% of his storage space, he will no longer be able to compose a message. A message will inform the user that room must be made on the account before messages can be sent. If storing a sent message would exceed a user’s allocated space the message will not be sent instead an error will explain why the message cannot be sent. Messages that cause users to exceed their allocated storage space will not be delivered. The sender is notified that the message cannot be delivered because the mailbox belonging to the intended recipient is full.


Set up the address for the D2L Postmaster


Once your organization has determined its domain, you can save the address and name that Postmaster messages are delivered from. For example, messages that inform users that email could not be sent originate from the D2L Postmaster address.

Email configuration options
Most organizations use one of three common email configuration options:
Send-only email - Send-only email allows users to send but not receive email. Users are provided with an address book containing contacts from the courses they are enrolled in. They might or might not be able to add additional contacts. Users are not given a Brightspace specific email address. Additional disk storage space is not required for send-only email. Copies of sent messages are not stored in Brightspace.
Course email - Course email provides users with an email account that they can use to send and receive emails from other users in Brightspace. Users cannot send emails to or receive emails from external email accounts. The system automatically populates their address books with contacts from the courses they are enrolled in. Users might be allowed to add contacts of their own to the address book.
Full email - Full email provides users with an email account that they can use to send and receive emails to both internal and external contacts. The system automatically populates their address books with contacts from the courses they are enrolled in. Users might be allowed to add contacts of their own to the address book.
It is possible to customize configurations by setting configuration variables and permission settings individually. You can customize some email permissions by role. Depending on which configuration your organization sets up, you may not have access to all email features described in this section.
Internal email addresses are addresses created by Brightspace and tie to a user account in the learning management system. External email addresses are managed outside Brightspace (e.g., email@gmail.com). You can associate an external email address with your Brightspace email using the email settings. 
Note: If you add or update your reply-To or Forwarding email address, you will receive an email prompting you to verify your email address. To verify your email address, click the link in the email verification message you received.
If your organization chooses Send-Only email, everyone within the organization will have Send-Only email. If your organization opts for Full Email, tailored permissions can be given on a role-by-role basis, including reducing roles to Send-Only capabilities.



--------------------------------------------------


Set up email for your organization

In the d2l.Tools.Mail.D2LMailDomain configuration variable, save your organization’s domain.
In the d2l.Tools.Mail.PostmasterAddress configuration variable, save the Postmaster’s Address.
For Course email or Full email, in the d2l.Tools.Mail.StorageSpace configuration variable, save the per user storage space limit (in Kb). The default value for d2l.Tools.Mail.StorageSpace is 0 Kb, which indicates unlimited storage space.
Combining email configurations
The following chart indicates the settings required for configuration variables and Roles and Permissions for each of the commonly used configurations. Each common configuration is based on a set of individual permissions. Configuration variables not listed in the chart below do not need a specific setting.

About DMARC email authentication

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, & Conformance (DMARC) is an email authentication specification used to protect internet domains against attackers attempting to use those domains to send fraudulent email to users.
DMARC is used in conjunction with one or both of the following email authentication systems:
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) identifies which mail servers are allowed to send email on behalf of a domain, preventing attackers from sending fraudulent emails using that domain name. The list of authorized mail servers is contained in a specifically formatted SPF TXT record, which is published in the Domain Name System (DNS) records for the sending domain.
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) enables an organization to associate a domain name with an email message allowing the receiver to validate the sender. For added security, by employing a mechanism to sign outgoing messages with a private key, allows receiving mail exchangers to check that incoming mail from a domain is authorized by that domain's administrators. DKIM can be enabled for organizations using a custom mail domain by submitting a Service Catalog request.
Sent messages
In early 2016, Google and Yahoo implemented stricter DMARC policies to their email services to protect more types of email. For organizations that use Google or other third-party email services, this might impact the configuration of email in Brightspace.
Depending on your configuration, when an individual sends an email, the FROM address is listed as that individual's email address. This is helpful for the recipient in identifying the sender but may cause problems when the sender's email is an external domain. 
For example: if the organizational email domain is hosted by Gmail and a learner with an email address using the Gmail domain sends an email to another learner with a Gmail account, Gmail rejects the message. This is due to Gmail's DMARC "p=reject" record D2L servers sending the email are not approved to send on behalf of the Gmail-hosted email domain. If the email message was signed with additional information, Gmail allows the email to be received.
Forwarded messages
Emails forwarded from D2L servers appear to originate from a sender’s D2L domain - in the format of {username}@{D2LMailDomain} - instead of the original (external) sender account. Email headers  show the new FROM address as the user’s D2L email address, and the REPLY-TO address as the original sender’s (external) email address. 
Example of how forwarded emails appear:Reply-To: {OriginalSender}@{ExternalDomain}From: {Student}@{D2LMailDomain}To: {Student}@{ExternalMailDomain}Subject: FW: Example Email------------------------------------At {HH:MM AM/PM} on {Long Format Date}, "{Original Sender}" <{OriginalSender}@{ExternalDomain}> wrote
Notes:
•	If your organization filters/rejects emails based on the FROM address, the DMARC specification could cause email filters to function in unexpected ways. You may need to adjust filters to account for this email forwarding standard.
•	Refer to Best practices for outgoing mail to ensure you have correctly configured SPF and CNAME records for your organization. If you do not set up the SPF correctly for the D2LMailDomain, then your organization or external mail providers with very strict spam policies will reject correctly forwarded email messages.



--------------------------------------------------


Mail Exchanger (MX) records requirements

As part of the alignment to industry standards, depending on the type of mail being used, you might be required to maintain several additional DNS records. One of the following scenarios might apply to your organization:
Scenario 1: Client uses D2L mail domain
D2L handles the creation and management of the required email records to ensure mail sent from Brightspace conforms to DMARC and related SPF and DKIM protocols.
For example: If Brightspace is configured to use mail domain clientmail.brightspace.com, D2L creates MX, DMARC, and TXT records, as well as DKIM signatures ensuring mail sent using any brightspace.com mail domain is delivered by recipients applying the DMARC policy.
Scenario 2: Client uses branded non-D2L mail domain 
You must create an SPF TXT record for the mail domain that allows D2L Cloud to send mail on your behalf, as well as CNAME records pointing to the D2L DKIM TXT records publicizing a public domain key. D2L generates and maintains the private domain key to create a DKIM signature for mail sent from D2L Cloud using your branded mail domain. 
For example: If Brightspace is configured to use mail domain mail.client.edu, D2L generates and publishes a private/public domain key pair as a TXT DKIM record You create CNAME records for d2lmail1._domainkey.mail.client.edu and d2lmail2._domainkey.mail.client.edu pointing to the D2L TXT DKIM records and the TXT SPF record for mail.client.edu including a._spf.brightspace.com. D2L encodes mail sent using the branded mail domain with the DKIM signature to ensure that recipients applying the DMARC policy can decode the headers and verify the sender. D2L will rotate the active DKIM key every six months. When one key is rotated, the second will become active in signing emails, after which the process will repeat at six-month intervals. 
Note: If your organization is using a non-D2L domain that you do not own, DMARC is not supported with your Brightspace.



--------------------------------------------------


Best practices for outgoing mail

You must add SPF and CNAME records for your domain to allow D2L to send mail on your behalf.
Note: If your organization is using a non-D2L domain that they do not own, DMARC is unsupported with Brightspace.
SPF record
If no current SPF record exists, create the SPF record including:
{Client mailDomain} TXT -> "v=spf1 include:a._spf.brightspace.com ~all" 
Note: The ~all is at your discretion (the ~ means it’s to be treated neutrally, in terms of SPAM scoring, if the record doesn’t come from an SPF certified source). 
If an SPF record exists, add the following to the SPF record:
{Client mailDomain} TXT -> "include:a._spf.brightspace.com"
CNAME record
Create two new CNAME records using the following format: 
d2lmail1._domainkey.{Client mailDomain} CNAME d2lmail1._domainkey.brightspace.com
d2lmail2._domainkey.{Client mailDomain} CNAME d2lmail2._domainkey.brightspace.com
Email signing 
A private and public domain key pair is required to allow D2L to sign mail sent on your behalf and enable recipients to decode headers and verify the source of the email.
D2L generates the private and public domain key pair and imports it for use in signing email messages sent from the D2L Cloud on behalf of your domain. D2L provides the public DKIM TXT records to your organization for use in creating the corresponding CNAME records.
D2L will rotate the active DKIM keys every six months. When one key is rotated, the second will become active in signing emails, after which the process will repeat at six-month intervals. For organizations that have DKIM keys enabled and are using a custom mail domain, email delivery may be impacted if both required DKIM CNAME records are not in place at the time of rotation.

About Data Purge

The Data Purge tool enables you to create data sets which you can purge or store as archived files. A data set is a collection of individual information items you can group together because they all share a common attribute. For example, Assignments, Grades, Quizzes, Announcements, and Homepages all belong to an Org Unit. An Org Unit data set contains all of these components' data and files information.
Data Purge helps you archive data, reclaim system storage space, and manage records according to your institution's data retention policies. Before you archive or purge data, you should review the data in the purge set for potential issues (such as courses that are currently in use). Once processed, purged data sets cannot be restored. You can only access archived data sets from the designated file location. You cannot store or purge root org units such as your entire organization. Data Purge does not process data sets that contain Org level IDs.
You can create the following data set types in the Data Purge tool:
Org Unit data set - Can contain course materials (such as Content), user activity (such as Discussions, Quizzes, Grades, Assignments, Checklist), and files in the course path. 
User data set - Can contain profile information, activity log, emails, locker files, Assignments Turnitin data, user enrollment, and user collections.
Instance data set - Can contain orphaned information and data that does not belong to categories in Org Unit data or User data. For example, orphaned questions in Question Library would belong to an Instance data set. To purge an instance, contact D2L Support.




--------------------------------------------------


Brightspace Data Sets and the Data Purge tool

Under the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the right to the erasure of personal information is provided to individuals so that their data is removed from systems where it is no longer required. For detailed information on how all GDPR rights generally affect D2L's customers’ use of Brightspace, browse to: https://www.d2l.com/legal/gdpr/
To erase user data in Brightspace, the Data Purge tool is an option; however, using the  tool impacts user data in Brightspace Data Sets.
What user data is deleted in Brightspace Data Sets?
You can create the following data set types in the Data Purge tool:
Org Unit data set - Can contain course materials (such as Content), user activity (such as Discussions, Quizzes, Grades, Assignments, Checklist), and files in the course path. Note: The Course Files option does not include user contributed files (such as assignment submissions); you must select the User Contributed Files.
User data set - Can contain profile information, activity log, emails, locker files, Assignments Turnitin data, user enrollment, and user collections.
Instance data set - Can contain orphaned information and data that does not belong to categories in Org Unit data or User data. For example, orphaned questions in Question Library would belong to an Instance data set. To purge an instance, contact D2L Support.
Brightspace Data Sets are generated from the data in database tables. When an administrator uses the Data Purge tool to purge data and files from a user data set, that user data is removed from database tables. The next time Brightspace Data Sets are generated, the following data sets are updated to reflect changes to user data:
Users Data Set - The user record is deleted.
User Logins Data Set - All logins associated with the user are deleted.
Session History Data Set - All session records associated with the user are deleted. However, if a user impersonates another user, then the created session is associated with the impersonated user and is not deleted. Once the user is deleted, then any sessions they created under impersonation cannot be traced back to them as the impersonating user.
User Enrollments Data Set - All enrollment records associated with the user are deleted.
Quiz Attempts and Survey Attempts Data Sets: IP addresses associated with quiz and survey attempts are anonymized.
What user data is anonymized in Brightspace Data Sets?
User data is not deleted from additional Brightspace Data Sets. Instead, the user data in those data sets is anonymized so that it can no longer be joined with a user data set to determine who the information belongs to. For example, a deleted user is anonymized in the Assignment Submissions Data Set and Quiz Attempts Data Set.
What should you do after deleting user data?
After deleting user data, D2L recommends that you update the data in your database by doing one of the following:
Locating the deleted records (by comparing them with a weekly or daily full data set) and permanently deleting them.
Overwriting the data in your database with full data sets.

The WAF checks all traffic coming in to the Brightspace cloud environment to match rules. Traffic that matches its rules, which indicate that the traffic is a potential security concern, is not allowed into the servers. As a result, suspicious traffic does not reach your environment, further reducing the likelihood of an infrastructure-affecting security incident.
The WAF checks if the traffic is coming from a known suspicious IP that may be a potential security concern and if the traffic is coming from outside of a client’s region.
The second check is in place to avoid the possibility of blocking all traffic from a client in the unlikely event that a customer is negatively impacted by the WAF.
If you receive inquiries from users blocked by the WAF, troubleshoot the user’s issue to determine if they are using a proxy or a virtual private network (VPN). If this is not the case, reach out to D2L to determine if the WAF is blocking legitimate traffic.
If users experience time out errors when using an out-of-region VPN or proxy server, D2L recommends users to access Brightspace using a different method.

Protect the privacy of enrolled learners

Protect the privacy of enrolled learners 
Enable or disable the display of users' non-directory information by selecting or clearing User Information Privacy role permissions. Non-directory information is information your organization holds private. Directory information includes anything that should be visible to users, like the information in a telephone book. 
User Information Privacy permissions determines if non-directory information such as users' first, last, and middle names, username, email, and org defined ID are visible in tool data (such as discussion posts, survey attempts, grades, etc.).
To further protect the privacy of enrolled learners, administrators can also define preferred names that are distinct from legal names. For example, a transgender user with a different first name or a user commonly known by their middle name. Once set, the user's preferred name appears everywhere in Brightspace, in place of the legal name. For more information, refer to Preferred names.

SAML Administration Overview

SAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, enables users to access multiple web applications using one set of login credentials. SAML based Single Sign-On (SSO) is the most often requested method for user authentication within Brightspace. Since SSO is a customer managed workflow, D2L built an administrative front-end to configure, troubleshoot, and maintain it. This guide provides information on registering an identity provider without the need to engage D2L Support for assistance. 
D2L's SAML implementation is certified against:

Azure


ADFS


Shibboleth


G Suite


WSO2


Okta


OneLogin


PingFederate

Additional identity providers may work with D2L's SAML implementation.
Although SAML based SSO is the most requested SSO methods offered within Brightspace, it isn't the only one. A customer may wish to proceed with one of the others (OIDC, LDAP, GUID SSO, CAS) which do not have client self-serve capabilities and still require engagement with Implementation Services.
SAML Administration
The SAML Administration tool consists of three main areas:

Identity Providers


Set the Default Brightspace Log in Experience


Troubleshoot issues by enabling SAML logging

For new customers or any existing customer that isn’t using SAML SSO, the User interface indicates that, You have no registered SAML identity providers. The first step is to add an identity provider by clicking, Add Identity Provider.



--------------------------------------------------


Enable Just-In-Time User Provisioning

The Just-In-Time User Provisioning (JIT Provisioning) function helps users to log in to Brightspace and automatically creates their Brightspace user account without an administrator intervening.
Each time users log in using Just-In-Time User Provisioning, their data is updated with the data obtained from the identity provider. If a user has no account in Brightspace, their account is created using details provided by the SAML user claim attributes when the user logs in for the first time.
To enable Just-In-Time User Provisioning
Note: Ensure the Manage SAML Authentication and Manage SAML JIT Provisioning Configurations permissions are granted to administrators at the org level.

From Admin Tools (click the Gear icon on the upper right corner), click SAML Administration.Figure: Admin Tools with the SAML Administration option highlighted.


Click Add Identity Provider. Add a new provider as described in Add an Identity Provider topic. As a result, you will be redirected to the Manage Identity Provider page.


Select the Manage Just-In-Time Provisioning tab.
Figure: The Manage Identity Provider page with the Manage Just-In-Time Provisioning tab highlighted.


Enable JIT Provisioning Enabled (its default value is OFF) to create Brightspace user accounts from the attributes of your identity provider automatically.


Click Clear configuration.Figure: The Manage Just-In-Time Provisioning page with the JIT Provisioning Enabled and Clear configuration highlighted.


From the Attribute Map section:

	Select Update attributes on login.


Ensure that the User/Name ID Mapping attribute is not updated on the Identity Provider side.


Set the mapping for the Mandatory attributes:


Brightspace Attribute	
	Statement Attribute
First Name*
FirstName
Last Name*
Last Name
Username*
Username
OrgDefinedId
UserId
Email
Email
Role*
UserType
Figure: The Attribute Map section.Warning: The user attributes shown in the Attribute Map section need to exist in the SAML SSO system as well as Brightspace. Depending on your specific system, these can be added to the user profile and then mapped to SAML Attribute statements. Consult with your SSO onsite experts and/or your SSO vendor.


From the Role Map section:

Select Update role on login.


Create a list of role mappings. Click Add Mapping to add a new pair, then select the Brightspace role from the list that maps to the Provider role.Figure: The Role Map section.Note: Each Provider role must only be mapped to one Brightspace role. The same Brightspace role may be mapped to multiple Provider roles. You can add more mappings or delete existing ones.



Click Save and Close.

After you enable JIT Provisioning, a JIT Provisioning Enabled label appears on the Manage page and in the list of Identity Providers on SAML Administration.
You can use the JIT Provisioned Users Log data set to answer questions about how many users have been created via SAML for troubleshooting or auditing purposes.



--------------------------------------------------


Permission requirements

The Security > Manage SAML Authentication permission is required to access the SAML Administration tool. Once the Manage SAML Authentication permission is enabled, the SAML Administration tool is visible under Admin Tools > Security.
The Security > Manage SAML JIT Provisioning Configurations permission is required to manage SAML JIT Provisioning Configurations within SAML Administration. 
The Custom Reporting Framework > Can see data hub permission is required to see Data Hub for the JIT Provisioned Users Log.



--------------------------------------------------


Manage an Identity Provider

Add an Identity Provider

Visit your organization’s Identity Provider tool or website and create a new application.


In Brightspace, from Admin Tools select SAML Administration.


Click Add Identity Provider.


From the Add New Identity Provider page, collect the Brightspace Metadata URL by clicking Copy.
Note: The Brightspace Metadata URL is typically all the information that is required, however, if your application requires the contents of the Metadata URL, click See detailed metadata and collect Entity ID / Issuer, Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) / Reply URL, or All Brightspace Metadata (full XML metadata).


Add this information to your new application on your Identity Provider’s site.


In Brightspace, set the Display Name to easily identity the purpose of the registered Identity Provider. Example names include Learner Log in, Faculty Log in, or Primary Log in, although any name can be used.


Click Import from your Identity Provider to display the Identity Provider Application Metadata URL (optional) input, and the Import from URL button.


If you have a publicly accessible metadata URL available from your Identity Provider, click Import from URL. This pre-populates the following fields:

Entity ID / Issuer


Single Sign-On Service (HTTP-Redirect) URL


X.509 Signing Certificates



If you do not have a publicly accessible metadata URL available from your Identity Provider, populate the following fields manually with information from your Identity Provider:

Entity ID/ Issuer


Single Sign-on Service (HTTP-Redirect) URL


X.509 Signing Certificate



Set the User / Name ID Mapping option.
Note: The User / Name ID Mapping field is used to create a mapping between the end user’s identity provider user account and their Brightspace user account. The options include: Username, Org Defined Id, Email Address, Username or Org Defined Id. Depending on what option is chosen you must set use the appropriate format. Username and/or Org Defined Id require the unspecified Subject NameId format be used. Email Address requires the emailAddress Subject NameId format to be used.


Populate the optional field for Logout Redirect URL (optional). This URL is used to redirect the end user when logging out of Brightspace. D2L recommends using the URL of your organization's homepage.


Populate the optional field for Failed Log in Redirect URL (optional). This URL is used to redirect the end user when an SSO log in attempt fails. This overrides the standard D2L failed login error page.


Click Save.

Validate Identity Provider
Once an Identity Provider has been registered, the Registration Complete page displays. This page includes an overview of the Identity Provider which was created during the Add Identity Provider steps. Ensure that all of the information is accurate. If necessary, click Edit Configuration to make any required changes.
Test an Identity Provider

From the Registration Complete page, click Test your new Identity Provider.


Copy the Log in URL and attempt to load the page from your browser.


Confirm that you are being successfully logged in to the correct page.

If it is necessary to make changes to an existing registered Identity Provider, on the SAML Administration page, click on the name of the identity provider you need to edit. Common update tasks include updating the Log out Redirect or Failed Log in Redirect URL, or manually adding a new X.509 Signing Certificate.
The Manage Identity Provider page displays an overview of the registered identity provider along with options to Edit Configuration, Add New Certificate, and Delete Identity Provider.
Selecting Edit Configuration, allows you to perform the following tasks:

Edit the Display Name


Edit the Single Sign-On Service (HTTP-Redirect) URL


Change the selected User / Name ID Mapping


Add, Edit, Remove the Log out Redirect URL


Add, Edit, Remove the Failed Log in Redirect URL

Ensure you save all changes when updates are complete.
Note: If a publicly accessible metadata URL was provided to initially register the Identity Provider, it cannot be updated or removed. This is intentional.
Note: If a mistake was made when manually entering the Entity ID / Issuer, this cannot be changed. The Entity ID is the unique identifier of the client’s Identity Provider, therefore the appropriate action is to delete the registered Identity Provider and start the registration process over again with the correct Entity ID.
Selecting Add Certificate, allows you to add a new X.509 Signing Certificate. For any Identity Provider that has been manually registered (not pre-populated leveraging a publicly accessible metadata URL), periodic certificate renewals are required to maintain SAML SSO functionality. Registering a new X.509 Signing Certificate for an existing registered Identity Provider can be performed from the Manage Identity Provider page as well.
Adding a new X.509 Signing Certificate can be performed by either clicking Add new Certificate on the Manage Identity Provider page, or by clicking the Add new Certificate button under the Manage Certificates subheading.

On the Add New Certificate page, paste your certificate information in the X.509 Signing Certificate field.


Ensure the Valid From dates and all other information is correct and click Save.

For any Identity Provider that has been manually registered (not pre-populated leveraging a publicly accessible metadata URL), periodic clean-up of expired certificates is a recommended best practice. 
Note: If the Identity Provider was registered using a publicly accessible metadata URL, any expired certificates are deleted by the nightly recurring task.

On the Manage Identity Provider page, click on the certificate to access the View Certificate page.


Click Delete Certificate and confirm the deletion by clicking Proceed.

If your organization is switching from one Identity Provider to another (for example, ADFS to Azure), or if you incorrectly registered the Identity Provider (for example, an incorrect Entity ID) during the initial registration it may be necessary to delete an existing Identity Provider.

On the Manage Identity Provider page, click Delete Identity Provider.


A confirmation displays, click Delete to complete the deletion of the Identity Provider and any registered X.509 Signing Certificates associated to it.

Note: Once deleted, an identity provider cannot be restored.
Troubleshooting
At the bottom of the Registration Complete page is the Common Troubleshooting Issues area, which contains the detailed requirements necessary for SSO to function based on the selected User / Name ID Mapping.
If issues arise when testing a registered Identity Provider, on the SAML Administration main page there is a Troubleshoot Issues by Enabling SAML Logging card. Clicking Enable Logs captures additional debug, information, and warning log messages related to SAML SSO, and are viewable in the System Log.
The default amount of time specified is 24 hours, but this can be overridden or disabled.



--------------------------------------------------


Set the Default Brightspace Log in Experience


From the SAML Administration page, locate the Set the default Brightspace log in experience card.


Once an Identity Provider has been added, the display name you set for it displays here as an option along with Local Brightspace Log in Page.


Select the radio button next to your Identity Provider’s display name and click Save.


If you choose to switch back to the Local Brightspace Log in Page option, select the radio button next to Local Brightspace Login Page and click Save.

Note: If you're currently using a custom login page, the Set the Default Brightspace Log in Experience card is disabled, and the following message displays: A Custom Login Page is currently in use. Please contact D2L Support to modify your login experience.

About Config Variable Browser

The Config Variable Browser allows you to define how specific functionality in D2L tools should operate for an organization, an org unit (such as a course), a role, or a user. A configuration variable is a specific setting for a tool or set of functionality. For example, configuration variables are used to integrate with third party software, set default user preferences, and specify storage limits.
The Config Variable Browser has a hierarchical folder structure that allows you to browse for and modify configurations by category (for example, security) or by tool or feature. You can also search for configuration variables by name or keyword within all variables, a category folder, or a tool or feature folder.
While in the Config Variable Browser, you can navigate backwards or forwards using your browser without losing your state in the Config Variable Browser when the page refreshes. You can also bookmark pages in the Config Variable Browser.
The effect of a variable depends on its scope. Variables can apply to the Brightspace system, organizations, org units, users or roles.
Note: Depending on your permissions, some configuration variables may be read-only, while others may not be visible at all. Specifying which variables are read-only and which are visible can only be done by high-level administration. If you require additional access, contact your senior site administrator or your D2L Account Manager.
Hierarchy and naming of configuration variables
Configuration variables are organized into folders and sub-folders and are available from the tree structure in the Config Variable Browser. Folders are indicated by the  Folders icon, while variables are indicated by the  Variable icon. When you select a variable, its properties and value display.

Figure: The Configuration Variable Browser interface
Each variable’s name reflects the hierarchy of folders in which that variable appears, as a series of prefixes separated by periods with the structure: d2l.folder.subfolder.variable. For example, the  d2l.Tools.Blog.AllowExternalViewing configuration variable is in Tools > Blog, and it determines if blog entries can be viewed by individuals who are external to your D2L environment.
The following table lists all of the folders for configuration variable categories in the Configuration Variable Browser:

Control settings and configurable options for each tool in D2L (for example, Grades, Quizzes, Metadata).

Configuration variable types
There are different types of standard configuration variables. The scope of a variable’s effect (the org units and users affected by the variable) and the way the variable is edited through the Config Variable Browser is determined by its configuration variable type. A variable’s type is labeled (in brackets) beside the configuration variable when it is selected.
The following are standard configuration variable types:
Org variables - Apply to the entire organization. When an org setting is changed, it immediately affects all users and all org units in the organization.For example, the setting d2l.Tools.Content.HasComments is an org variable that controls whether users can add comments when editing content modules and topics. If this setting is disabled, it immediately disallows all users in all org units from adding comments to a module or topic in the Content tool.
Org Unit variables - Are values or settings for each org unit. For example, “Anthropology 101” and “English 101” could have different settings. When updating an org unit variable, you first select the org unit you want to apply the value to and then specify the value. The new setting is applied to that org unit immediately, and does not affect any other org units.The only exception to this is the value for the organization; this value applies to the organization itself (as an individual org unit) and also serves as the default for all other org units that do not have a customized value specified. When the value for the organization is changed, all org units using the default value are affected.When viewing an org unit variable, the current value for each org unit is displayed in the Values table. Org units using the default value are not displayed. When the value for the organization is edited, the new value is applied to all org units not listed in the Values table.In many cases, org unit settings can be modified within the org unit itself. For example, the variable d2l.Tools.Competencies.Users.ActVisible is an org unit variable that determines whether competency activities are displayed to users on the Competency Results page. This value can be different for different org units and can be modified within the org unit through the Settings page. When a user modifies this value through the Settings page, the org unit where the value has been modified is added to the Values table for the variable, along with the specified value.
User variables - Store the values for settings specific to each user in your organization. In most cases, users are able to change their settings through the interface.Unlike org unit variables, the values for individual users are not displayed in the configuration variable, nor are you able to change the settings for individual users through the configuration variable. With User variables, the only thing you can do through the configuration variable is change the value for the organization, which is applied to new users created after the setting is changed and existing users who have not yet accessed the associated functionality.For example, the variable d2l.Tools.Discuss.ShowPreviewPane is a User variable for the Discussions tool that controls whether discussion posts display in a preview pane or a pop-up window. By changing the value of this variable for the organization, you control whether the preview pane displays for new users and users who have not yet accessed the Discussions tool. Users can change this setting through the Display Options dialog in the message list.
User–Org Unit variables - Store the values for personal settings users can specify on an org unit by org unit basis (i.e. users can specify a different value in each org unit).In the configuration variable, these variables work like user variables. You cannot see or modify settings for individual users, and setting the value for the organization changes the option for new users and users who have not yet accessed the associated functionality for all org units.
System variables - Are settings that apply to all organizations on the same instance. Most organizations only allow high-level site administration to edit system variables. Lower-level administrative staff should not be able to see these variables, or should see read-only copies.
Session variables - Store temporary information about a user’s current actions; their values expire when the user logs out of the system. While these variables appear in the configuration variable, they cannot be updated, nor can you see individual values for specific users.
Role–Org Unit variables - Apply to specific user roles. These variables are configured by selecting a role and then setting the value for that role. The value is immediately applied to all users enrolled in the organization in that role.For example, the variable d2l.Tools.Mail.StorageSpace is a role–org unit variable that controls the maximum space available for saved email messages. This value can be set for each role, so that you can provide different amounts of storage space to different roles in your organization.
The following table describes how setting each configuration variable type affects users and org units:

Role permissions and configuration variables
Role permissions are not the same as configuration variables; however, the two objects share a relationship in Brightspace. When you set a configuration variable, you are configuring specific functionality in Brightspace. When you set role permissions, you are configuring what aspects of that functionality are available to the role. For example, you can set the configuration variable that allows locker file sharing in your Brightspace. As a security measure, you can choose to disable locker file sharing for the guest role.

Set configuration variable values

Administrators must have the Can Edit Config Variable Values permission to edit configuration variables. Changes to configuration variables can affect all users, all courses and your entire Brightspace system, depending on the variable scope. D2L recommends that only 1 or 2 administrators in your organization have permission to edit configuration variables. There is no view-only permission for configuration variables.
If you do not see the Config Variable Browser item in the  Admin Tools menu, then you do not have permission to make changes to existing configurations variables for your Brightspace instance.

Homepage Widget Expansion Pack configuration variables

Homepage Widget Expansion Pack configuration variables are used for each System Widget included in the Homepage Widget Expansion Pack (HWEP). These configuration variables are now available to system administrators.
Homepage Widget Expansion Pack configuration variables have the following format: d2l.Custom.LCSWidgets.[WidgetName].ContextOverride. This format enables you to change contextual information pieces, such as role definitions directly from the configuration variable and replaces the need to edit the code of custom widgets. The Learner Awards, Multi-Profile, Slim Announcements, and Welcome Window widgets use this configuration variable to link the widget's permissions to different system roles using a JavaScript string. The rest of the HWEP widgets also have this configuration variable, but they do not currently  use it. Refer to the table below for the available variables.
The following table indicates the configuration variables used to edit the individual permissions of all HWEP widgets.

d2l.Integrations.IPSIS.ParallelBulkJobs


 


0 (which implies no limit)


This config controls how many bulk jobs can be actively downloading and parsing files at one time. It does not prevent more bulk requests from being made from the admin tool - those requests are processed right away. This indicates the number of bulk jobs that can be processed in parallel. Since each Org can only process one Bulk Job at a time, the number effectively equates to the number of orgs that can have bulk processing occurring at once.
This config is not editable by Org Admins (Install Admin and D2LSupport Only).


d2l.Integrations.IPSIS.ParallelBulkDownloads


 


10


This config indicates the maximum number of downloads allowed per bulk job. For example, if five jobs are running in parallel and this config is set to allow ten downloads per job, then potentially 50 files could be downloaded at the same time.
This config is not editable by Org Admins (Install Admin and D2LSupport Only).


d2l.Integrations.IPSIS.BulkTaskFrequency

This config is not editable by Org Admins (Install Admin and D2LSupport Only).


d2l.Integrations.IPSIS.GradeServiceFrequency


 


10 (seconds)


The number of seconds between each run of the grade export service. The value should always be greater than or equal to 0. If it is not, the grade export service runs every 10 seconds and issues a warning on each run.
This config is not editable by Org Admins (Install Admin and D2LSupport Only).


d2l.Integrations.IPSIS.EnrollmentServiceFrequency

The number of seconds between each run of the background enrollment service. The value should always be greater than or equal to 0. If it is not, the background enrollment service runs every 30 seconds and issues a warning on each run.


d2l.Integrations.IPSIS.ParallelGradeJobs


 


0 (which implies no limit)


This config controls how many grades export jobs can be actively running at one time. It does not prevent more grades export requests from being made from the admin tool - those requests are processed right away.
This config is not editable by Org Admins (Install Admin and D2LSupport Only).


d2l.Tools.Grades.ExportHandlerPage


 


There is no default value for IPSIS.


This variable is used by both Banner Grades and IPSIS Grades Export Utility.
Installations which have both Banner and IPSIS need to make sure to set this value to avoid the Banner default conflicting with the IPSIS installation.
For example, if Banner is installed this config variable has a default value which applies to all Orgs/OrgUnits. To ensure the Banner default isn't applied to non-Banner Organizations, this variable can be set to an emptyvalue and override the default value.


d2l.Integrations.IPSIS.LIS.MaxBulkTransactions


 


4


This config controls the number of transactions that the IPSIS Bulk Service Manager simultaneously processes. Generally, bulk data files are organized by type of data, such as all person records, then org units, then memberships. When the Bulk Service Manager detects multiple consecutive records of the same type, it processes the records in parallel, which reduces the overall time to process bulk files.
Values less than 1 are not accepted, and the default of 4 is used.
This config is not editable by Org Admins (Install Admin and D2LSupport Only).

About roles and permissions

Use Roles and Permissions to set what functionality is available to different users. Permissions correspond to tools in Brightspace and D2L products, for example, the ability to create discussion topics or edit an org unit’s navbar. You assign permissions to roles and then assign roles to users for specific org units. When a user accesses an org unit, they have access to the features set up for their role in that org unit. 
Use Roles and Permissions to do any of the following: 
Create, define, change, delete, and copy user roles. 
Set user permissions around roles. 
Import and export permissions. 
Role permissions versus configuration variables
Role permissions are not the same as configuration variables; however, the two objects share a relationship in Brightspace. When you set a configuration variable, you are configuring specific functionality in Brightspace. When you set role permissions, you are configuring what aspects of that functionality are available to the role. For example, you can set the configuration variable that allows locker file sharing in your Brightspace. As a security measure, you can choose to disable locker file sharing for the guest role.
Roles and Permissions terminology

Term


Description


Org units


Org units define the structure of an organization. By default, Brightspace contains org unit types for course offerings, course templates, departments, semesters, and the organization. You can define custom types to match your organization’s structure, such as consortium, college, community of practice, cohort, etc.


Role


A role is a mechanism for storing a set of permissions. Assigning permissions to a role dictates what users in that role are able to see and do in the system. You can create any number of roles for your organization and enroll individual users in different roles for different org units.


Cascading roles


If a role is cascading, a user enrolled in any org unit in that role is automatically enrolled in all other org units beneath it. For example, if you enroll a user in the science department in a cascading role, the user is automatically enrolled in all course templates, course offerings, and groups and sections under that department. Cascading roles are normally used for site administration.


User enrollment


You assign permissions to a user for a specific org unit by enrolling the user in that org unit in a specific role.

System Widgets Permissions

Note: The legacy Homepage Widget Expansion Pack has reached the End of Support milestone and will be retired in September 2024/20.24.9. Clients can continue to use the hosted versions of the widget until that date; however, they are no longer supported by D2L. Clients using the legacy hosted versions of widgets should upgrade to the new Brightspace System widgets. For more information about how to identify which legacy widgets you are using and plan for the retirement of the Homepage Widget Expansion Pack in your environment, refer to Upgrading from the Hosted Widgets.
The Homepage Widget Expansion Pack widgets retrieve (or in some cases, store) information required for the widget to function properly. For information associated with the current org unit (e.g., default widget configuration overrides, table of contents, classlist, etc.), the information come from the current org unit; and required permissions are tied to the user's role in that org unit. 
For information associated with the organization (e.g., default widget configuration, roles, etc.), the information comes from the organization; and required permissions are tied to the user's role in the organization. For situations where a user's role in the current org unit differs from their role in the organization, required permissions are tied to the user's role at the level that the information is coming from.

Troubleshooting: Course Conversion

The following errors might be encountered during course conversion into D2L format. Try these troubleshooting steps first, and if they don't work, contact support for a more in-depth investigation of the issue.
Error: Package was not recognized
A package may not be recognized if:
It is not in a course archive format (for example, it is a .ppt or .pdf file instead of a course package exported from an LMS).
It was exported from a vendor that is not yet supported by D2L.
It failed to unzip.
Package Failed to Unzip
Symptoms
When importing a course package, you encounter the message: "The package was not recognized". The processing logs indicate "Unpackaging uploaded file" followed by "Unsupported file format". If the package was successfully unzipped, the processing logs would indicate "Successfully unpackaged file" instead.
The processing logs also indicate that the final status of the issue was "NoConversion". You can access the processing logs directly on the error page in Course Import by clicking on "View Processing Logs".
Cause
The following are common causes of this error: 
The package is not a valid archive file (for example, .zip, .mbz, .imscc, etc. which have been exported from an LMS). Verify that the file is an Archive or Compressed Folder file type before attempting your course import. The following file types are not valid for importing a course: .pdf, .ppt, .docx. If you are trying to add course content, use Content Tool - Add Module instead.
The course package does not have an imsmanifest.xml at the root level and it may instead be located in a sub-folder.
The course package contains file paths that are longer than 128 characters, which is a Windows limit.
An archive file has been corrupted or damaged.
Resolution
If you are using an archive file, to verify your course package can be extracted, try to unzip the package locally first. Try the following steps to resolve the problem:
Use the built-in operating system extraction program and try to unzip the file on your computer.If you successfully unzipped the package on your local computer, re-zip the file using your local operating system zip program or the program you were using. Retry the course import with the newly zipped package.												
Unzip the package and examine the folder structure to ensure that the imsmanifest.xml file is at the root level. If the imsmanifest.xml file is not at the root level move the file to this location and re-zip the package and retry the course import. 
Use WinRAR (http://www.rarlab.com/) to unzip the file on your computer.Your package may contain file paths longer than 128 characters. In this case, most extraction programs on Windows will fail. WinRAR will still extract the files, but will warn that files exceeding the maximum path length were truncated. Once the extraction is complete, it is recommended that these paths are truncated manually or removed. Then re-zip the files and retry the course import. 
Re-export your course package from the original source.If neither of the previous troubleshooting steps worked and the extraction still fails, your course package is likely damaged. Re-export the course package from the original LMS and retry the course import with a newly exported package.
Error: Package was not converted
This error commonly arises due to issues within the course package itself:
There may be key files missing (for example, imsmanifest.xml is a typical file expected to be among the course package structure).
There may be issues with XML in some of the files (for example, the files may have illegal characters or unmatched opening and closing brackets).
Typically, it is recommended to review the processing logs and inspect the specific complaint. Then explore the contents of your package to verify that the information is corrected. You can also try to re-export the package from the original source.
Invalid HTML
Symptoms
When importing a course package, you encounter the message "The package was not converted". The processing logs may indicate that an invalid or unexpected character has been encountered.
The processing logs also indicate that the final status of the issue was "ProcessingFailed". To access the processing logs directly on the error page in Course Import, click View Processing Logs.
Cause
Invalid XML can often cause conversions to fail. Sometimes the error directly names the exact file that is causing the problem. If it is not explicitly stated, try the main imsmanifest.xml file. If the manifest is improperly formed, serious issues may occur.
Resolution
To verify that an XML file is valid:
Open the file in Google Chrome. If the XML is valid, it should render correctly; if not, the page will remain blank or report an error.
Use an online XML validator like: http://www.xmlvalidation.com/
If the XML is invalid, correct the XML, re-zip the package and retry importing your course package.
 the XML is valid, the issue with your package is likely in the structure of the package (for example, missing key files). In this case, re-export the package from the original source and retry importing your course package.
Error: Conversion Service is Temporarily Unavailable
If the Conversion Service is not available, it may relate to temporary issues that are being monitored by D2L support and will be resolved shortly. However, if you repeatedly see this error message, it may be worth verifying that the Conversion Service URL is properly configured. This can only be done by a D2L support representative.

Custom hosted widgets that will be replaced with system widgets include: 
Visual Table of Contents Widget
Welcome Window Widget
Photo Banner Widget
Learner Awards Widget
Slim Announcements Widget
Single Profile Card Widget
Content Navigator Widget
Custom hosted widgets that will no longer be supported include:
K12 Calendar
K12 Footer

Check if your widgets need to be replaced
If you have the Create/Edit Homepage permission, a warning message is displayed on all Custom Hosted widgets active on the homepage in the following format: “Action Required: Widget Update: Support for this widget is ending. For automated support to replace this widget visit HWEP EOL Support Service.” 

Figure: Use the in-widget message service (for example, in the Visual Table of Contents Widget) to navigate to the HWEP EOL Support Service.
Note: A similar warning also appears on the Homepage Management tool page if there are Custom Hosted versions of widgets active in the environment. Click on this warning to navigate to the Custom Widget Automated Replacement Service page.
From the Custom Widget Automated Replacement Service page, you can do the following:
Check a list of all Custom Hosted widgets and the number of homepages the widget is active on.
Find the exact locations where each widget is active by clicking on a number in the corresponding row of the Homepages Using Legacy Widgets column.

Figure: Use the Custom Widget Automated Replacement Service page to locate, replace, or remove Custom Hosted widgets.
 For more information about how to identify which legacy widgets you are using and plan for the retirement of the Homepage Widget Expansion Pack in your environment, refer to Upgrading from the Hosted Widgets.
Note: Automated replacement functionality will be added at a later date.

About Game Based Learning

Game Based Learning (GBL) is the use of games to enhance the learning experience.
Incorporating game based mechanics, visual design, and thinking into a course can help organizations improve learner motivation and engagement. Learners who are engaged are more inspired to succeed.
A highly interactive gaming experience is something that many learners are already comfortable with. They can proceed at their own pace and get immediate feedback about their progress.
In a game based environment, learners work towards a set goal. A risk-free setting encourages experimentation by letting them choose their own actions. They can even repeat a step if they need to.
Instructors can determine the scope and depth of the gaming experience, implementing game based learning that fits unique needs and objectives.
In the spirit of gaming, learners can personalize their learning experience by creating their own unique character (an avatar) using the Create Avatar process. The avatar is visible when learners access the Game Map.
Enable Game Based Learning
From the Admin Tools menu, select Organization Tools.
Toggle on Game Based Learning.
Add Game Based Learning link to a Navbar
Open the Admin Tools menu and select Navigation & Themes.
Click the name of the navbar you want to update.
On the Edit Navbar page, click Add Links.

About Discover

Discover allows learners to search for active courses by entering terms that match course titles and descriptions. Searching indexes up to 4KB of data (approximately 4000 characters or 550 words) from the description of each course and activity. Only courses that allow self-enrollment (configured by course administrators or instructors) appear in the search results. From the search results, learners select a course and enroll.
Note:
Discover is available to Brightspace Core clients in all regions, except Singapore and India. Clients in Singapore can use Discover; however, data is not stored in the Singapore region.
By default, all courses configured to display in Discover are visible to any role within your organization. However, you can configure role-based access or custom user attribute-based access to individual courses using Enrollment Rules. For more information, refer to Control user access to courses with Enrollment Rules.
To make it easier to index multiple courses for Discover, developers can use the Brightspace Developer Platform API to enable the Is Discoverable option on new or existing courses. Once the option is enabled, and courses are made active, those courses are visible in Discover, available to learners for self-enrollment. For information, refer to Brightspace Developer Platform documentation.
Discover does not offer a public-facing eCommerce page where potential learners can view available courses and sign-up or register and create a new account.
Discover does not support the following:Pre-requisite, anti-requisite, or co-requisite course offeringsSeat limits, wait lists, or enrollment windowsMultiple catalogs of coursesSections or groups self-enrollmentRole selection during self-enrollmentNote: While it is not possible for a user to select the role they want to be when they self-enroll in a course, you can set the default role for all users that self-enroll on a per course basis. This is configured by choosing the Value in the d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole config variable. This config variable role setting can be combined with cascading Org Unit Types to set the default role that should be used for all courses within a department, for example.SIS integration or enabling self-enrollment in bulk

--------------------------------------------------


Control user access to courses with Enrollment Rules

To ensure that only relevant courses are available to users who meet specific criteria, users with the correct permissions can manage enrollment rules using the following methods:

Use the Enrollment Rules page to edit, delete, or create a new enrollment rule and apply it to multiple courses. This workflow allows a user to create an enrollment rule first and apply that rule to as many courses as required.


Review, add, or remove enrollment rules applied to a course from the Course Offering Information page of a course.

Before you create and add Enrollment Rules
To ensure that you can create and add enrollment rules in Discover, it is important to note the following:
By default, all courses configured to display in Discover are available to any role within your organization.
The Manage Discover permission is required to:Access the Enrollment Rules page from the Discover page.Access the Create Enrollment Rule button from the Enrollment Rules page.Edit or delete rules from the Enrollment Rules page.Access the Manage Enrollment Rules link on the Course Offering Information page, which opens the Enrollment Rules page.
To access the Add Enrollment Rule button on the Course Offering Information page, you must either have the Configure Availability in Discover permission, or the Manage Discover permission applied to your role. Either of these permissions will grant access to the Add Enrollment Rule button.
The User Information Privacy > See First Names and See Last Names permissions are required to:View user initials in enrollment rule cards.   If these permissions are not granted, users see user profile images instead of initials.
The User Information Privacy > See Usernames permission is required to view a list of attributes when creating an enrollment rule based on a custom user attribute. If this permission is not granted, users do not see any attributes for a custom user attribute. For example, with the permission, users see all users that are managers for the Manager custom user attribute.

When creating an enrollment rule, it is important to understand that there are two different types of Conditions that can be applied to an enrollment rule based upon a user's purchased version of Brightspace. 

Brightspace Core customers can use the Create Enrollment Rule page to specify role values for the Role in Organization condition. Users can apply enrollment rules to a course and select from up to 10 role values to apply to the Role in Organization condition. For example, Learner or Instructor.


Customers of Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups can add more than one condition to an enrollment rule each with custom User Attributes. Users can apply  enrollment rules to a course, with each enrollment rule containing a maximum of 10 conditions and 10 custom user attributes per condition.Note: If you are creating enrollment rules based on User Attributes configured through Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups, you must continue to use the User Attributes tool to upload and update attributes into your Brightspace instance. This is to ensure that newly-created users continue to satisfy the requirements of an enrollment rule based on user attributes. If you do not continue to upload user attributes, newly-created users may not have the required user attributes assigned to their role, and therefore, enrollment rules based on those attributes will not be correctly applied to that user. This can result in courses showing as available to users, even though they do not satisfy the enrollment rule requirements. For more information  refer to Importing Attributes.



Multiple enrollment rules are treated as "or" statements and custom user attributes are treated as "or" statements in conditions. Adding another condition treats each condition as an "and" statement.


If you make a course unavailable in Discover, any enrollment rules are permanently removed from the course.

Important: If you are using API Valence to configure enrollment rules for a course, you must perform a GET to obtain the correct CanSelfRegister value. This value must be FALSE when enrollment rules are set in a course.
Create an enrollment rule and associate it with courses
You can use the Enrollment Rules page to create an enrollment rule, add conditions to that rule, and associate that rule with multiple courses. This enables you to apply an enrollment rule to multiple courses easily.
To create an enrollment rule and add it to courses

From your organizational homepage, navigate to Discover.


Select More Actions > Enrollment Rules.Figure: Select Enrollment Rules to open a list of all enrollment rules created in Discover.


From the Enrollment Rules page, select Create Enrollment Rule.Figure: Select Create Enrollment Rule to create a rule, add conditions to the rule, and associate it with multiple courses.


From the Create Enrollment Rule page, do the following:

Enter a Rule Name.


Under Conditions, next to Role in Organization, select the desired role or roles. Figure: Specify an org unit (role) as a condition of your enrollment rule.Note: Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups users can add multiple custom User Attributes to a condition and select + Add Another Condition to apply multiple conditions. Figure: As a Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups user, select +Add Another Condition to apply more than one condition to your rule.


Under Courses, select Add Courses and do the following:

From the Add Courses dialog, search for and select the courses that you would like to add.Note: You can also select the check box at the top of the list to select all courses visible in the list.Figure: Use the Add Courses dialog to search for courses, select courses, and add courses to your enrollment rule.


 Select Add to associate the courses with your enrollment rule.Note: If you add a course to your rule that is not yet available in Discover, it is made available in Discover to users that satisfy the conditions you have added to your rule. To remove a course from your enrollment rule, navigate to the Courses section of the Create Enrollment Rules page and click the X next to the course you want to remove.




To create your new enrollment rule, select Save & Close.

Your enrollment rule is added to the Enrollment Rules page. 
Edit or delete an existing enrollment rule
Once you have created an enrollment rule, you can edit that rule to change conditions, add courses to the rule, remove courses from the rule, or delete the rule.Note: Any existing enrollment rules created before the August 20.23.8 release display with an auto-generated name that takes the attribute values from the first condition within a rule. For example, if an existing rule has Role in Organization values of Learner and Manager, the rule's auto-generated name displays as "Learner, Manager". All existing rule names are editable and can be deleted.
To edit or delete an existing enrollment rule

From your organizational homepage, navigate to Discover.


Select More Actions > Enrollment Rules and do one of the following: 
To edit an enrollment rule, use search for the rule and click to open the rule in the Create Enrollment Rules page. Figure: Search for and select a rule to open and edit it.
To delete an enrollment rule, select the Delete Enrollment Rule icon next to the rule and select Delete Rule.Figure: Search for  the rule you want to delete and select the Delete Enrollment Rule icon to delete it.Note: Deleting an enrollment rule can result in the removal of the last rule applied to a course. If a course no longer has any enrollment rules assigned, then it will no longer be visible to users in Discover. This is also the case if you remove a course from an enrollment rule, resulting in that course to have no other applied rules.

You have successfully edited or deleted an enrollment rule.

Manage and track course enrollments with Discover

To allow instructors to track users who are self-enrolling in courses using Discover, you can optionally create a new service account user role with specific enrollment permissions, and then set the d2l.System.Enrollment.DiscoverUserId configuration variable.
This action enables enrollment logs to record Discover (or a custom name related to self-enrollment through Discover) as the Enrolled By type.
Figure: A user Enrollment Log with Discover listed under the Enrolled By heading.
Note: If administrators choose not to configure enrollment logs, D2LSupport is recorded by default.
Create a new role to track self-enrollment
The first step in tracking user self-enrollment from the Enrollment log is to create a new role.
To create a new role
 From the Admin Tools menu, select Roles and Permission.
Click Create/Copy.Figure: The Create Role page.
Click Start Fresh.
From the New Role page, do the following:Figure: The New Role page. Enter a name for your new role.Important: D2L strongly recommends that you name this role Discover Service Account.   Select Cascading Role.
Click Save to create the role.
The new role is created.
Set permissions for the Discover Service Account role
Once you have created the Discover Service Account role required for enrollment tracking, you must assign the required permissions to that role so that the Discover Service Account can use that role to enroll users in a course.
Note: This workflow assumes that you have already set up and configured a Student or Learner role for Discover. Refer to the Set up Discover to allow learners to self-enroll in courses topic for details.
Important: If you are using Discover with Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups, the enrollment permissions added to the service account user role should apply to the corresponding role configured in the Manager Dashboard config variable, instead of the role identified in the d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole configuration variable. Contact D2L support if you do not have access to this permission.
To set role permissions

 From the Admin Tools menu, select Roles and Permission.

 Set the following role permissions for the Discover Service Account role:			
Users > View User Enrollments at the Course Offering level.Users > Search for <Student or Learner Role>  at the Course Offering level.Users > Enroll a <Student or Learner Role> at the Course Offering level.Note: The student or learner role you created when setting up Discover is the same role that the user will be enrolled as, also known as the Learner role.
Click Save and Close.
The permissions required to track self-enrollment are set for Instructors.
Create a new user account for the role
The next step is to create a new user account for the role you have created. This new user account acts also provides the as a service User ID (uid), which is then specified in the new configuration variable.
To create a new user account

 From the Admin Tools menu, select Users.


Click New User. Create a new user account by using the newly created role.Important: D2L strongly recommends that you name this new user account Discover Service Account 


Take note of the User ID (uid) of this account by referencing your browser URL. For example, the uid could be displayed at the end of the URL as uid=12128.

You can now add this uid to the required configuration variable so that you can track user self-enrollments.
Add a role user ID to the configuration variable
The next step is to add the User ID (uid) recorded in the previous workflow to the d2l.System.Enrollment.DiscoverUserId configuration variable.
To add role user ID to configuration variable
From the Admin Tools menu, select Config Variable Browser.
Edit the d2l.System.Enrollment.DiscoverUserId configuration variable and add the new role. 
Track user self-enrollment in courses
To allow instructors to track which users are self-enrolling in courses using Discover, administrators can now optionally configure enrollment logs to record Discover (or a custom name) as the Enrolled By type. If administrators choose not to configure enrollment logs, D2LSupport is recorded by default.
From the Users tool, instructors can then view which users are self-enrolling in course using Discover.
To view which users are self-enrolling in courses using Discover
From the Admin Tools menu, select Users.
On the Users page, click the context menu of a user and select View User Enrollment Log.
In the Enrolled By column, Discover (or the role name you chose) displays as the enrollment type.

About Course Publisher

The Course Publisher tool enables course providers to easily distribute courses from their Brightspace instance (the host LMS) to a partner's external LMS (the destination LMS or recipient). Once deployed to the destination LMS (as an AICC course package or LTI link), external learners access the courses from the destination LMS and are launched into the Brightspace host LMS, providing a seamless learner and administrative experience. 
From the host LMS, course providers track and manage course adoption, as well as learner progress, while results are sent back to the destination LMS (recipient) at the end of the course. This flexible deployment of course content is ideal for Brightspace users who are developing courses for third party clients and partners. It allows course providers to control access to their course content, ensuring the integrity and security of their intellectual property.

Additional benefits of Course Publisher:

External learners experience the full Brightspace course experience (including all available tools) when they access a course, regardless of the LMS they use.


Data about learner progress, recipients, and course packages is stored in Brightspace and can be tracked and reported on with Brightspace tools.


Course providers can update courses in real-time, without having to re-deploy course packages or LTI links to partners.


From the host LMS, course providers can easily toggle partner access to courses without deleting or re-publishing courses.


There is no administration of external user credentials or course enrolments from the host LMS; this administration is facilitated through Course Publisher.


AICC and LTI support grade/completion return to the destination LMS.

Note: The Course Publisher tool supports AICC 4.0 and LTI 1.3 Advantage standards.This means that an LMS that does not support one of these standards cannot integrate with Course Publisher packages. 
Course Publisher Workflow
The workflow for using Course Publisher is:

Publish a course package or create a recipient
From a list of courses in the host LMS, you can choose a course to publish. Next, name a recipient (your client) for the course package or select from the list of previously created recipients. If deploying course packages using LTI links, set up the LTI registration for the recipient. Then, publish the course package for deployment.


Deploy the course package
From the published course package page, you can download the AICC course package or copy the LTI link, along with the LTI registration information, and send it to the recipient.


Track and Manage Adoption
Once the recipient imports the AICC course package or configures the LTI link in their destination LMS and returns their deployment information to you to input in the Recipient settings, the course link is active and external learners can access the course from the destination LMS.
With a single-click from the destination LMS (your client), external learners are securely directed to the host LMS (you) to access the course content, engaging with the full Brightspace course experience.
Upon finishing the course, the host LMS can send a Final Grade and completion back to the destination LMS. Brightspace administrators have access to the same reports for external learners, just as they would for learners in the host LMS.

Publish a course package

To distribute courses to partners (recipients), choose one or more courses in the host LMS to publish. Each course is published as an individual course package. 
Note: To distribute the same course to multiple partners, D2L strongly recommends publishing a separate course package for each partner. If you deploy the same course package to multiple recipients, you cannot differentiate traffic from other recipients and access control for the course package applies to all recipients.

Figure: The Course Publisher interface for publishing a course package.
To publish a course package and create a recipient
From the Admin Tools menu, click Course Publisher.
Click Publish Course.
From the list, select the courses you want to publish, and click Select.
Enter a recipient name, for example, the organization's name.
Click Publish.
To publish a course package for an existing recipient
From the Admin Tools menu, click Course Publisher.
From the View By: Recipient list, click a recipient.
From the list, select the courses you want to publish, and click Select.
Click Publish.




--------------------------------------------------


Best practices for using Course Publisher

Be sure to set a value for  d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole (see below), which can be set at an org unit level. This value is also currently used for enrollment with the Discover tool.
If the user publishing courses is someone you don't want to grant administrator access to Brightspace, it should be a dedicated role with just the minimum permissions they need to publish courses (for example, the ability to see/manage courses, the Publish Course permission). If the user publishing courses is also a Brightspace administrator, you can just add the Publish Course permission to that admin role.
If using sections in the destination courses, ensure that the sections are set to auto-enroll new users and that the learner role is set to be auto-enrolled into sections. Learners enrolled into a course with sections, but not into a section, will have an unexpected experience in several tools.
When creating recipients, D2L recommends using a consistent naming convention so that you can later filter users by that recipient label. For example, if you publish a course package for Acme Inc, the recipient name in Course Publisher is “acme_inc." This also pre-pends the external users’ ID in Brightspace.It is not currently possible to rename of delete recipients.   
For deploying AICC course packages, D2L recommends sharing them via a secure channel (link to the AICC zip file through Dropbox or shared drive) with permissions granted to the user setting up the link on the destination LMS.Once an AICC package is shared, any destination LMS could deploy the package. If an unauthorized person gains access to a package file, they could install it in a 3rd party LMS without your knowledge. This would result in additional, unauthorized users accessing the course, which D2L would charge for as additional Brightspace users.
For deploying LTI links, D2L recommends sending an email with the LTI registration details, as well as the LTI link to the course(s), and applicable setup instructions for their LMS, if available, from this document. This ensures that the recipient at the destination LMS has all of the information required to set up the registration.
D2L recommends publishing courses that can be completed in a single session.
If an AICC package does not upload, you can test whether the AICC Package is formed correctly by uploading it into another application that supports AICC 4.0, such as SCORM Cloud.
Keep track of course start/end dates. If a published course has expired (i.e. the course start and end dates have been exceeded) and a user attempts to access this course from the partner’s LMS, they will receive an "Authorization Error Message." The course’s start/end dates will have to be extended, or removed, in Brightspace in order to re-enable access to the course.
When typing in the name of your recipient, you should use a name that allows you to manage the packages based on your business model. For example:
If you are selling course access to companies/organizations, use the company name as the recipient.If you are providing access to a partner network, use the partner name as the recipient.If you are providing access to multiple courses to a single recipient, use the same recipient name each time so that the end users are properly recognized as coming from the same recipient LMS and so that the packages are properly tagged as being for the same recipient.
In order to monitor and control access to content, D2L recommends publishing a different package file for each remote LMS that  accesses a course.
You may publish multiple package files per Brightspace course - each to a different recipient.
If a customer sees more than one Launch URL for a given package, this may indicate that the package has been installed in multiple remote LMS' and the customer should consider turning off access to that package.When creating a course, if returning final grades is required, ensure the course is set up to provide a final grade upon completion of the course and that the destination LMS is set up to receive a grade of the equivalent value.
When a learner completes their course session, they should end the session properly by using the Log Out option on the Learner menu:
Figure: The Log Out option available from the Learner options menu. 




--------------------------------------------------


Set up Course Publisher

Course Publisher is an available tool in your Brightspace instance if you are a Legacy or Core customer.
From the Admin Tools menu, select Roles and Permissions.
Configure a role for using Course Publisher, granting the Publish > Publish Course permission at the organization level.Note: If you do not see Publish as a permissions set, ensure that Publish is turned on in Organization Tools.
Ensure the d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole configuration variable is set with your specific role requirements.This is an org unit level configuration and can be set for different roles for different courses. However, all users currently inherit this role regardless of their role in their home LMS (recipient LMS).
To launch the Course Publisher tool, from the Admin Tools menu, click Course Publisher.




--------------------------------------------------


Create a recipient for a course package

A recipient is the client/partner/destination LMS receiving the course package, for example, [companyname] Inc. The recipient's name is used to generate learner usernames in courses published for that recipient, for example, [companyname]_Inc_LTIUniqueGUID.  
Important: Create only one recipient name for the recipient's destination LMS. Consider using an acronym if it is a long name. If you are publishing to/billing a specific department of your client, ensure to add this information  to the client name. You do not need to create a different recipient to publish to multiple departments if they use the same destination LMS, but it may be helpful for billing and tracking to do so. Currently, the recipient name cannot be renamed or deleted in Course Publisher.
Tip: You can also create a recipient when creating a course package. For more information, see Publish a course package.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Course Publisher.
Click Create Recipient.
Enter a unique name, for example, the name or acronym of the recipient's organization.
Click Create.




--------------------------------------------------


Deploy a course package

After publishing a course package, you deploy it to a partner (recipient) at a destination LMS by doing one of the following:
download it as an AICC course package and send it to the partner
copy the LTI link and share it with the partner 
Note the following:
Each course package consists of an individual course. 
D2L recommends distributing AICC course packages using a method the partner is comfortable with, ensuring it is sent to the intended audience only. For example, the AICC course package is a ZIP file that you can email or file share with partners.
To deploy course packages using LTI links, you must set up the LTI registration for each recipient  using LTI links to access those courses. The LTI link does not launch until LTI is registered for the recipient. For more information, see Set up the LTI registration for a recipient.

Control access to a course package

From the Course Publisher tool in the host LMS, you can toggle access to courses that are currently deployed at a partner's destination LMS. This allows you to control access to your course content, ensuring the integrity and security of your intellectual property, without deleting or re-publishing courses. 
Important: Turning off a course package disables access to the course for the recipient. In addition, external learners see an error message when they attempt to launch the course from the destination LMS. Course data, such as grades and quiz attempts, are preserved.

--------------------------------------------------


Set up enrollments

The Course Publisher tool enables course providers to set an enrollment limit and automatically manage role and section enrollment.
Set an enrollment limit
 You can set  the number of enrollments  for a particular course depending on your needs. The enrollment limit should be at least the current number of unique course users from that recipient.
To set an enrollment limit
From the Admin Tools menu, click Course Publisher.
Select the desired recipient.
Click the Package Config icon for the course.Figure: Click the Package Config icon (represented by a gear).
Select Enforce enrollment limit.
Enter your enrollment limit in the text box.
Click Done.

Figure: Check Enforce enrollment limit and enter the limit number in the corresponding field. Click Done to finish.
An enrollment limit is only applied to enrollments via Course Publisher; manual enrollments are unaffected. If an enrollment is removed from the course and Course Publisher initially performed that enrollment, the count is updated to reflect the change.
Set a specific section
You can set automatic role and section enrollment management to ensure that users are given the proper isolation and visibility for the course they accessed. When a user navigates from another LMS or Brightspace site through Course Publisher via an LTI link, they are placed in the correct role and into the correct section of the course.
For enrolling instructors, the  d2l.System.Enrollment.InstructorRole ( OrgUnit ) configuration variable must be set to the corresponding role

Course Publisher FAQ

General questions
I don't see Course Publisher on the navbar. How do I launch the tool?
From the Admin Tools menu, under Organization Related, click Course Publisher.
Note: The Publish tool must be turned on in Organization Tools and the course publisher role must have the Publish Course permission.
Can my partners integrate with Brightspace if their LMS is behind a firewall?
No. By design, the HTTP AICC Communication Protocol (HACP) requires that an LMS communicate over the HTTP protocol. However, you can create firewall rules to allow HACP traffic.
Can I publish courses for free?
For Core and Legacy Brightspace customers, Course Publisher is a freely available tool. However, users that enter your learning environment through Course Publisher are counted towards your Brightspace user count. D2L highly recommends contacting your D2L Account Manager to understand the impact on your contract.
Can I try this out on my test environment?
Yes. You can try connecting production to test through Course Publisher to see the workflow.
Do you integrate with other LMS' not listed here?
D2L can integrate with any LMS that is LTI 1.3 compliant or accepts AICC packages. You can check for LTI 1.3 compliance of any LMS on the IMS Global website.
Courses
I updated content in a course that is currently deployed at a partner's destination LMS. Do I need to re-deploy a new course package or send new LTI links to the partner?
No. Course providers can update courses in real-time, without having to re-deploy course packages or LTI links to partners.
What types of courses can you use to publish a course package in the host LMS?
You can only publish a course package from courses created with Brightspace’s course creation tools. However, those courses can contain anything a current course can contain – quizzes, scorm objects, assignments, groups etc.
Am I sharing my course content with my partners by giving them an AICC course package? Can they get access to my content outside the course?
No. The benefit of using the Course Publisher tool to publish an AICC course package is that the content is still hosted within your Brightspace instance. The content is not contained in the package, only the necessary information to access your hosted content and allow users in the destination LMS to search your course.
Do course packages support AICC 3.5 and 2.2?
No, course packages exclusively support AICC 4.0.
Can I send the same course to multiple partners?
Yes, but D2L does not recommend sending the same course package to multiple partners. To effectively manage the distribution of course packages, you can publish multiple course packages from the same course. When naming each package, create a unique recipient name that identifies the intended recipient's organization. If you deploy the same course package to multiple recipients, you cannot differentiate traffic from other recipients and access control for the course package applies to all recipients.
Note: The course publisher logs offer the ability to see where launches are coming from per course (by recipient). This allows you to determine if external learners are coming from elsewhere.
Users
Do external learners need to log in to Brightspace to access the learning content I provide them?
No, all course packages are accessed from the destination LMS through LTI or AICC depending on the workflow. To provide the best user experience for the learner, Course Publisher automatically provisions the necessary accounts required by Brightspace, based on the information provided by the authentication integration.
How is the Brightspace username constructed in the host LMS?
The first time an external learner in the destination LMS launches a course package, a Brightspace user is created in the host LMS. The username assigned is a concatenation of "recipient name" (used to publish the course package), underscore, and the LTI userID or username for AICC are transmitted by the destination LMS.  For example, if the host LMS publishes a course package for "[companyname], Inc", and the external learner accessing the course in the destination LMS has the username "John Smith," a Brightspace username of "[companyname_Inc_jsmithLTIGUID" for LTI (or “[companyname]_jsmith” for AICC) is created in the host LMS. The unique LTI ID is not a recognizable ID right now. The best way to find a user is with their email address. D2L is investigating a more efficient solution.
What learner role is used for external users accessing a course package?
To enroll new external learners into courses in the host LMS, Course Publisher uses the learner role defined in the d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole configuration variable. This configuration variable is also used by other tools such as Discover, so it may already be set. This is set by course, so you can have different roles for different courses if desired.
Can external users access course packages on a mobile device?
Yes, the user experience and reporting is the same from the web, tablet, or mobile device.
If an external learner in the destination LMS is taking multiple courses published from the same host LMS, are multiple users created in the host LMS for that one external learner?
No, assuming you used the same recipient name each time an AICC package was published. The username in the host LMS is formed as "recipient name_LMSusername". Therefore, all course packages with the same recipient name that are deployed on the same destination LMS use the same Brightspace username when enrolling a user into the courses.
What happens if multiple destination LMS' have an external learner with the same username? Will the host LMS think they are the same person and merge their user records?
Not if you correctly use unique recipient names when publishing your AICC course packages. For example, if jsmith exists in two destination LMS' and you use unique recipient names for those destination LMS', you would have users in the host LMS named "recipient name A_jsmith" and "recipient name B_jsmith." For LTI courses, the unique LTI ID is unique.
Reporting
If an external learner navigates to a course directly on the host LMS, is their activity sent back to the host LMS?
No. To communicate activity to a destination LMS, content must be launched from within the destination LMS. If an external user accesses the course directly from a URL, the activity is still reported to the course.
After launching a course package from a destination LMS, what activity is reported to the destination LMS? What activity is reported to the host LMS?
Course completion and grades are reported  to the destination and host LMS'. However, this activity is only reported to the destination LMS if the learner launches the course from the destination LMS. The AICC standard does not allow transmission of course progress.
Can I see where external user traffic is coming from?
Yes, the Course Package tool allows the course publisher  to monitor course activity and revoke access to specific AICC course packages as required.
What information is passed back and forth between the host LMS and destination LMS?
AICC:
Inputs: Username, User ID, Launch URL
Outputs: Completion, Final Grade
LTI:
Note: Although there is more information that can be passed from LTI links, the following functional information is specific to Course Publisher workflows:
Inputs: Authentication/Launch parameters Username, User ID, EmailOptional (For Brightspace to Brightspace publishing): Org Defined ID.
Outputs: Grade and completion is sent back when final grade in the course is set, even if the user closed the course
Troubleshooting
I get an error when launching the Brightspace course link
In the LTI configuration information, ensure that all fields are input correctly and there are no trailing spaces or slashes.
The learner cannot see their User Progress
Your course might have sections and the learner is not in a section. Ensure that the learner is enrolled into a section and that the section is set in the future to auto-enroll new learners.
The learner received a course completion as soon as they launched a course
A course package sends completion as soon as it is launched by a learner; the grade does get passed until later.
I deleted a user account in the publisher LMS, but the enrollment for the course still counted the user
When a user launches a course via LTI into a published course, and the user account is then deleted (in the publisher LMS), the course enrollments still counts that user. You cannot delete a user account from Course Publisher; this is for accounting purposes.

About Quick Eval

Quick Eval offers evaluators a single location to view all learner submissions that are awaiting evaluation. Submissions made to Assignments, Quizzes, and Discussions are displayed in a sortable list and can be selected to take you directly to their assessment page. Educators can sort, filter, and search submissions to prioritize their evaluation work. Sorting can be done using the first or last name of the learner, Activity Name, Course Name, and Submission date. Filtering can be done using one or more of the following categories: Activity Name, Course Name, and Submission Date. Clicking on a user’s name opens an evaluation screen directly from the Quick Eval list where the evaluator can complete their assessment. The search function in Quick Eval allows evaluators to locate submissions for evaluation by searching for a specific user, assignment, quiz, discussion topic, or course. Once you complete an evaluation, you can either publish your feedback, or save it as a draft and then return to the Quick Eval list to continue evaluating. Any assessment awaiting evaluation, or with its evaluation saved in draft status, displays in Quick Eval.
Submissions view supports anonymous marking for assignments created with the Hide student names during assessment option selected. Learner names and profile images do not display and are replaced by a generic profile image, and the name column shows Anonymous User. The d2l.Tools.System.Features.AnonymousMarking configuration variable must be enabled to display the Hide student names during assessment check box.
Allow unassessed activities to appear in Quick Eval after course end date reached
By default, unassessed activities do not appear in Quick Eval once a course’s end date is reached. The d2l.Tools.UnassessedActivities.DaysToExtendEndDate configuration variable allows administrators to determine if unassessed activities appear in Quick Eval after a course has reached its end date. The configuration variable allows you to choose the length of time past the course end date that the activities display: it can be set to 7, 30, or 60 days beyond a course’s end date.

Quick Eval widget
The Quick Eval widget can be added to an organization homepage to allow instructors to view and access any submissions awaiting evaluation. The Quick Eval widget displays a list of up to six activities with submissions to evaluate. The activities are sorted by due date, with the earliest date first. The icon indicator in the widget shows the type of activity (assignment, discussion, or quiz), and the number of unevaluated submissions for each activity. The course name is also displayed when viewing from an organization or department homepage.

Evaluation status: Ungraded quiz attempts
What are the criteria for displaying discussion posts and replies in Quick Eval?
Discussion topic setup: Discussion topics with Assessments
Evaluation status: Unpublished Feedback
Are grade items listed in Quick Eval?
Quick Eval does not list grade items. Quick Eval only lists activities from Assignments, Quizzes and Discussions that have learner submissions.
Are SCORM objects or LTI activities listed in Quick Eval?
Quick Eval does not list SCORM objects and LTI activities like Bongo video assignments.
What is the default size of the Quick Eval list?
The Quick Eval list shows 20 unevaluated learner submissions. Users can click on Load More to see more items.
Are group assignments listed in the Quick Eval list?
No, group assignments are not listed in Quick Eval.
Can I filter the Quick Eval list by section?
No, the Quick Eval list cannot be filtered by sections. However, an evaluator only sees submissions from the sections they are enrolled in.
Does Quick Eval display feedback saved as a draft?
Quick Eval displays feedback for Assignments, Discussions, and Quiz Attempts that are saved as a draft and not published.
Can I evaluate Anonymously using Quick Eval?
Submissions view supports anonymous marking for assignments created with the Hide student names during assessment option selected. Learner names and profile images do not display and are replaced by a generic profile image, and the name column shows Anonymous User.
Why is Anonymous User displayed instead of the learners first name and last name in Quick Eval?
Assignments created with the Hide student names during assessment option selected display Anonymous User in place of the user’s first and last name.
If the org level role of the user evaluating using Quick Eval does not have the User Information Privacy permission at the org level, then learner names are displayed as Anonymous User.
Why is Quick Eval empty when I impersonate using an instructor role that has the View Quick Eval permission?
Quick Eval requires the user to be explicitly enrolled in the course in order to see unevaluated learner submission. Impersonating an instructor role does not have the course enrollment, therefore the Quick Eval list is empty.
Are Tool usage trends captured for Quick Eval in the Adoption Dashboard?
Yes, tool usage trends are captured for Quick Eval. More information can be found in the Using the Adoption Dashboard help topic.

About Lessons

Lessons is a way for instructors and learners to experience the Content tool in Brightspace. It offers a simplified experience for organizing content, aligning to learning standards, managing the availability of course materials, and automatically scheduling content units as a pacing guideline. You can now import from the Achievement Standards Network and map content items to those standards. Instructors can also add their own materials from external sources, such as Google Drive, to supplement existing resources. To promote classroom engagement, the Lessons experience works with Activity Feed, allowing instructors to easily post content materials to a course homepage.



--------------------------------------------------


Set up Lessons

Enable Lessons configuration variables 
For Lessons to be available, ensure the following configuration variables are turned on:
d2l.Tools.Content.IsLessonsEnabled
d2l.Tools.Content.UseLessonsExperience
To allow instructors to opt in or out of the Lessons experience, ensure the following configuration variable is turned on for the desired roles:
d2l.Tools.Content.ChooseContentExperience
Note: When you opt in to the Lessons experience, if your course content is more than four levels deep (unit > lesson > folder > topic) and if the d2l.Tools.Content.IsLessonsEnabled, d2l.Tools.Content.UseLessonsExperience, and d2l.Tools.Content.ChooseContentExperience configuration variables are turned on, a notification appears stating that some content cannot be displayed. You are directed to modify the course structure in the old Content experience before trying out the new Content experience.
For improved interaction with learners directly from Lessons, turn on Activity Feed and add the Activity Feed widget to course homepages:
d2l.Tools.ActivityFeed.ShowWidget
To customize the language term used to describe learning outcomes, set the following configuration variable to one of the available options:
d2l.Languages.Terminology.LearningOutcomes
Note: Options include Standards, Competencies, Expectations, Objectives, and Outcomes.



--------------------------------------------------


Lessons and Activity Feed

Lessons include the option to add materials to course homepages that include an Activity Feed. This allows instructors to bring upcoming work to the attention of learners in an easy to access location.
Navigate to a course with Lessons enabled, that has an Activity Feed.
On the navbar, click Content.
Select a content item.
From the Options menu, select Post to Course Homepage.
Enter any necessary comments and click Post.

About Learning Outcomes

Learning outcomes are pre-defined skills or areas of knowledge that a learner should be able to demonstrate when they finish the activities associated with the outcomes. Learning outcomes provides an alternative way to evaluate proficiency at skills and mastery of concepts.
Learning outcomes are defined either by an instructor or by an overseeing body such as a university program director, a school board, a government body, or a professional association.  Instructors use outcomes to ensure they are meaningfully covering the outcomes they are expected to teach. Outcomes can be evaluated or measured using various assessment styles.
Note: The language term used to describe learning outcomes in the user interface depends on the value set for the d2l.Languages.Terminology.LearningOutcomes configuration variable. There are currently five options for this term. The term selected applies to all instances of learning outcomes as well as to the name of the tool.  For example, the Standards tool link in Course Administration might be labeled Competencies, Expectations, Objectives, or Learning Outcomes.
Levels of Achievement 
Levels of achievement are the success milestones that indicate progress toward meeting the expectations of a defined standard. Levels of achievement are often mapped to levels of evaluation on rubrics or numeric score thresholds. The achievement levels describe the thresholds of mastery on the learning journey to meeting the learning outcome. 
Achievement Scales
Achievement scales are the range or spectrum of achievement levels that indicate when a learner has or has not met the expectations of a learning outcome. Where the outcome provides a statement of knowledge or skills that the learner must know to meet the learning outcome requirement, the achievement scales provide a comparative measure of performance across multiple assessment activities. 



--------------------------------------------------


Comparing Competencies and Learning Outcomes

The features within the Learning Outcomes tool have some overlap with the Competencies tool. While the ultimate objective is to retire the Competency tool in favor of the Learning Outcomes tool, there remain some functional areas that D2L is  working to address in our roadmap. To determine which tool is most appropriate for your organization, it is important to understand both the use-case for each, and the features offered within (or coming soon) to each tool.
Each table indicates if the task is in the tools (indicated by Yes), not in the tool (indicated by No), or scheduled for development in a forthcoming update (indicated by Roadmap).

Migration Path 
  Once the development on Program Outcomes is complete, D2L will develop a migration path for existing competency clients to transition to the learning outcomes tool. The Competency tool will not move to the End of Life status until a migration utility is available to assist clients who use the Competency tool to migrate their courses to the Learning Outcomes Tool. 
Considerations
If you are using the Rubrics tool, the Competency tool must be enabled in Organization Tools, even if it is not being used, in order for the Rubrics tool to work properly. Currently there is a hard-coded dependency between these two tools which will eventually be removed. 
You can use both the Competency tool and the Learning Outcomes tool in the same organization at the same time; however, only one tool can be active in a given course offering. The evaluation and performance data remains separate in the Brightspace Data Sets. 
Additional information
For more information about the difference between Competencies and Learning Outcomes, refer to About Learning Outcomes. 



--------------------------------------------------


Set up Learning Outcomes

Enable the Learning Outcomes tool
You can access the Standards Coverage gauge, View Standards features, and import standards from the Achievement Standards Network (ASN) by enabling the Learning Outcomes tool in the Organization Tools.
To enable the Learning Outcomes tool

On the Admin Tools menu, select Organization Tools.Figure: The Organization Tools button in the Admin Tools menu.


On the Tool Availability, scroll down to the Learning Outcomes section and toggle it on.Figure: The Learning Outcomes tool.Note: Remember to not disable the Competencies tool in your environment. Even if you plan to only use the Learning Outcomes tool, there are many dependencies between the Competencies tool and the Rubrics tool in the current settings. Disabling the Competencies tool prevents you from attaching rubrics to your assignments and could cause other issues.





--------------------------------------------------


Create and manage Learning Outcomes

Create a learning outcome at the organization (program) level
In the Standards tool, Programs provide the opportunity to create higher-level learning outcomes that apply to multiple courses and can be imported into a course. Programs are optional to use; however, if you are using them in your organization, you should add them before you consider course-level learning outcomes.
At a high level, you create a program and then add standards that will apply to the whole program. You can add standards from ASN (Achievements Standards Network), or you can manually create custom standards.
Note: The name of the Learning Outcomes tool and some menu items and links therein depend on the language term you have defined in the d2l.Languages.Terminology.LearningOutcomes configuration variable. Based on that setting, the Standards link in Course Administration might be labeled Competencies, Expectations, Objectives, or Learning Outcomes In this topic, assume the configuration variable is set to Standards.
If you are not already in the Learning Outcomes tool, using a role that has the Manage Content and Manage Programs permission at the org level, click Admin Tools.
Under Organization Related, click Standards.
Click Programs.
Click Create Program.
Enter a program name.
Click Create.
Click the name of the program you just created.
Do one of the following:Click Add Standard to manually enter a program-level standard, then add a standard description and click Save.Click Import Standards to import a standard from ASN. Select filters for Jurisdiction, Subject, Framework, and Education Level as appropriate. Select a standard from the Available Standards list, then click Import Selected Standards.
If you want to add a lower-level standard below the one you just added, delete the standard, or edit the standard you just added, click the More Actions button beside the Standard you added.
These learning outcomes appear at the course level in the list of learning outcomes available to import into a course. Instructors can also create child outcomes to the existing ASN or previously created custom outcomes. 
Edit Learning Outcomes
Outcomes can be imported into programs at the org unit or imported and aligned to rubrics to assignments, quiz questions, or discussion topics at the course level.  
When copying outcomes from one course offering to another, the default behavior is for the outcome to remain linked to the source course. Changes made to the source outcomes are automatically pushed to the linked copies. If you want to edit custom created outcomes in the target course, the outcomes must be detached, either individually, or in bulk. To solve this issue, the copied objects must be unlinked in the target course to be editable. When custom created learning outcomes are unlinked from the source course, they become their own object. Once the link is broken, they no longer inherit changes from the source outcomes. This is useful in a scenario when you want to create an update to a master course shell or to teach a new course based on another course with similar but not identical outcomes.
Note: This feature does not apply to Achievement Standards Network (ASN) or Program-imported outcomes. It is only available for custom-created outcomes.
A warning message appears when you start this action to confirm that you intend to unlink custom created outcomes from the source and that there is no undoing this function.
Use the Import/Export/Copy Components tool to copy one or more learning outcomes from a source to a target course. Then, in the target course, using the Standards tool, select one or more outcomes to detach from the source course. 
To assist in knowing which learning outcomes can be edited from a user’s current location, there are icons to indicate if an outcome is locked (cannot be edited)  or is a linked copy (cannot be edited unless it is unlinked first).
Note: If you edit outcomes that have been copied to one or more different courses, the changes you make are inherited in all the target courses; however, if you make changes to target courses, the changes are not saved back to the source course. A confirmation message is displayed in the source course to indicate that edits to copied outcomes are inherited in all the copied target courses.
Using Learning Outcomes in Quizzes
Before you can use Learning Outcomes in Quizzes, ensure that you meet the following pre-requisites:
The new Quiz Builder experience is enabled
Learning outcomes are enabled in the course where the quiz resides.
At least one Learning Outcome has been added using the ASN or manually created in the course.
An Achievement Scale has been created in the organization and set as the default scale.
Monitor the re-evaluation service
When a competency structure change initiates evaluation, the elements affected are added to a table in the re-evaluation database and processed by the re-evaluation service the next time it runs. The Competency Service Jobs page lists the elements in the database table.
If automatic re-evaluation is disabled, elements are still added to the database table but they are flagged to be ignored by the re-evaluation service until a user manually requests re-evaluation. Once you manually initiate re-evaluation, you can check and see if the element is processed from the Competency Service Jobs page. The re-evaluation service normally runs at five-minute intervals.
Users require the See Competency Service Jobs role permission to access the Competency Service Jobs page.
From the Admin Toolsmenu, click Competency Service Jobs.
If the list is not updated automatically, click Refresh.




--------------------------------------------------


Import and manage Standards and Learning Outcomes

Import from Achievement Standards Network (ASN)
Note: To import standards from the Achievement Standards Network, ensure that the Learning Outcomes tool is turned on in Organization Tools. The Manage Outcomes permission for Learning Outcomes is also required to complete the standards import.
On the course navbar, click Lessons.
On the Lessons page, click Standards Coverage, and then Add or Remove Standards. You are directed to the Learning Outcomes Management page for the course.
Set the appropriate filtering options for Jurisdiction, Subject, Framework, and Education level.
In the Available items list, check boxes for the items you want to import. 
Do one of the following:Search for or scroll to find the standard you are looking for, then select the standard from the list. This list will not appear if the list was not previously created for the program. Click Import from Achievement Standard Network.Click Add Learning Outcome to create a custom learning outcome. 
To differentiate between similar standards, ASN outcomes provide a short code to assist in aligning outcomes to activities. You can also optionally add short codes when aligning user-authored custom outcomes. The short code appears  for both authored and ASN outcomes across view modes and pickers.

Figure: The Short Code field is available when you create new standards and in the list view of existing standards.
Copy Standards (Learning Outcomes) between courses
When you copy a course containing learning outcomes, both imported standards from the Achievements Standards Network and custom authored standards created at the program or course level are also copied into the target course. When selecting to copy standards with other course components, all other object references, such as alignment to rubric criteria, achievement scale mapping in the source course, and so on, are copied from the source to the target course as expected.
For ASN standards and program-level outcomes, the outcomes are copied as a reference (or link) back to the  source ASN or program. Any change made to the program source outcome is automatically inherited in all target courses. If a program outcome is copied to a target course, you cannot delete the program outcome at the source without first deleting the outcome from all target courses.
For custom authored outcomes in courses, the outcomes are also copied as a reference back to the source course. However, you can unlink copied outcomes to make changes to the target course. In this case, both the source course outcomes and the target course outcomes become distinct objects that are no longer connected.
Note: The Manage Outcomes permission for Learning Outcomes is required to copy Learning Outcomes between courses.
On a course navbar, click Course Admin and then click Import / Export / Copy Components.
Click Search for Offering and locate a course with existing learning outcomes.
Select the radio button next to the course name and click Add Selected.
Click Select Components.
Select the Learning Outcomes check box and click Continue.
Confirm the components to copy and click Finish.
When the import completes, click View Content.
The course standards coverage gauge displays.
Click Standards to view more information on learning outcomes and their alignment to content units.
More information on copying Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes can be copied using Copy Course Bulk (CCB), to copy into multiple course offerings in a batch process. CCB can copy from a master course into a large set of course offerings.
Copying activity-to-outcome alignments only requires the Manage Content permission.
Alignments copy automatically when activities are copied into new courses if both the aligned outcomes and the activities are copied at the same time.
Achievement Scales and Mastery View settings are included when using the Outcomes component to copy content to single courses with the Import/Export/Copy functionality. These settings are included when using CCB batch copy scripts to bulk copy outcomes.
When copying to existing courses, these settings do not overwrite any non-default options that have been set.
Copying outcomes into a course overwrites any existing required outcomes in that course.
Import standard alignments using Bulk Course Create (BCC)
If the Learning Outcomes tool is enabled in Brightspace, and the LOReS microservice is available in your region, the BCC process can create courses that contain outcome alignments. The template course being used must include outcome alignments for this to occur. If you want to edit the outcome alignments in the target course, the outcomes must be unlinked, either individually, or in bulk.
Note:  Bulk Course Create functionality is  available to copy ASN imported outcomes, Program-level outcome alignments, and course-level outcome alignments. 
Export standard alignments using Bulk Course Export (BCE)
If the Learning Outcomes tool is enabled in Brightspace, and the LOReS microservice is available in your region, the BCE process can include outcome  alignments metadata in course packages for ASN outcomes only. If curriculum outcomes metadata exists in the course being exported, there is no option to exclude the information from the export package. 
Note:  Bulk Course Export functionality is  available to  export outcomes imported from the Alignment Standard Network (ASN). 
Copying learning outcomes
You can copy learning outcomes between courses within the same Brightspace instance. When learning outcomes exist in a course offering, then they appear as one of the possible elements that you can copy between course offerings. When you copy learning outcomes, all related aspects of the Learning outcomes are also copied, including 

Assignments, discussions, quiz questions, and rubrics


Alignments to content topics


Locally authored outcomes


imported outcomes from programs or ASN

The target course in the copy process shows the outcomes as links to the source course. If you make changes to the description of the outcome in course-level locally-authored outcomes, then those text changes display in the target course. If only the target course requires text changes, you must break the link to the source course before you make the changes. 
Importing and exporting learning outcomes
If you export a course containing outcomes from ASN to a Brightspace format course package, then those ASN outcomes and their respective outcome alignments are exported with the course package and imported into another Brightspace instance. Non-aligned outcomes are not imported; the import rules apply only to aligned activities. ASN outcomes automatically appear in the course intent list of the destination course; however, you must manually re-add any desired course- authored outcomes to the course intent list.
Note: Currently, course-authored outcomes are not available for export or import with a course package. These features are scheduled for a future release.

About Measuring achievement using Learning Outcomes

The Learning Outcomes tool allows you to define scales for measuring achievement in learning outcomes. For example, as an administrator, you might create a standard scale for the entire organization that includes the following achievement levels: Does Not Meet Expectations, Meets Expectations, and Exceeds Expectations. 
Optionally, you can also choose to map achievement levels to percentage scores. This ensures that your organization uses a consistent mapping for assessing learning outcomes when they are associated with rubric criteria in an activity (discussion or assignment). To display suggested levels of achievement to instructors when assessing learner activities, enable  the d2l.Tools.LearningOutcomes.LoaSuggestions configuration variable. To hide suggestions, disable the configuration variable.

Figure: A scale with three levels of achievement mapped to percentage scores in the Learning Outcomes tool
After  importing standards from the Achievement Standards Network and copying standard requirements between courses, instructors can add learning outcomes to rubric criteria, discussion topics, quiz questions, or assignments.
After learners submit their activities, instructors use the scale to assess learners against the specified learning outcomes in the activity. For example, in an assignment, a learner might receive Meets Expectations for a specific outcome. 

Figure: Assessing an assignment submission against specific learning outcomes in an assignment.
If you mapped achievement levels to percentage scores when creating a scale and enabled the d2l.Tools.LearningOutcomes.LoaSuggestions configuration variable, suggested levels of achievement display below the rubric when instructors assess the activity for learning outcomes that are aligned to criterion levels on the rubric. This provides instructors with an idea of suitable assessments for learning outcomes based on the rubric. Instructors can choose to override suggested levels of achievement for learners, allowing them to exercise professional judgment when it comes to learner achievement. If you disable the d2l.Tools.LearningOutcomes.LoaSuggestions configuration variable, or if you align outcomes directly to the assignment, instructors can assess the learning outcomes; however, suggested levels of achievement do not display.

Figure: Suggested levels of achievement when assessing learning outcomes.
After instructors publish assessments, learners can view them wherever they can view assessments. This allows learners to understand their progress against learning outcomes and locate areas for improvement.
Note the following:
Note: The language term used to describe learning outcomes depends on the value set for the d2l.Languages.Terminology.LearningOutcomes configuration variable. For example, the Learning Outcomes tool or the Outcomes tab in an assignment can be labeled as Competencies, Expectations, Objectives, Outcomes, or Standards. By default, the Learning Outcomes tool displays as the Standards tool in the Admin Tools menu.
Mapping achievement levels to percentage ranges is optional and you can only add mappings when creating a scale. You cannot edit a scale to add or edit mappings; however, you can copy a scale to create a new scale and add mappings.




--------------------------------------------------


Set up an achievement scale

You can define achievement scales used to measure a learner's performance at the org level.
Create achievement scales for courses at the main organization level so instructors can select them. When you create and save the first achievement scale within the organization using the Learning Outcomes tool, that scale is automatically designated as the organization's default scale. Other scales can be designated as the organization's default scale at any time. Changing the selected organization default scale does not impact the achievement scale selection for any existing course offerings.
 Levels in your scale may have labels such as Beginning, Meeting Expectations, Exceeding Expectations, and Proficient. You likely already have an internal policy for these terms. In the examples here, there will be two levels: Not yet and Got it. Achievement scales can be available in all org units; a default scale applies to the entire org.
If you attempt to change the default achievement scale, an alert message appears to advise of the implications of making the change. If you change the scale and assessments have been completed using the previous scale, the previous assessments are excluded from the overall achievement calculations in the Grade book Mastery View. The assessments are also excluded from the performance trend line display in Outcomes Progress.
Note: The language term used to describe learning outcomes depends on the value set for the d2l.Languages.Terminology.LearningOutcomes configuration variable. For example, the Learning Outcomes tool or the Outcomes tab in an assignment can be labeled as Competencies, Expectations, Objectives, Outcomes, or Standards. By default, the Learning Outcomes tool displays as the Standards tool in the Admin Tools menu.
To create a new scale
Using a role that has the Manage Content permission at the org level, click Admin Tools.
Under Organization Related, click Standards (Outcomes). Note: The link name depends on the language term you have defined in d2l.Languages.Terminology.LearningOutcomes.
On the Standards (Outcomes) page, click Create Scale. 
On the New Scale page, enter a scale name and number of levels. 
Enter a color indicator and name for each level of achievement. 
If you also want suggestions for standards assessment based on a percentage (%) of points achieved on points-based rubrics, custom point-based rubrics, and quiz questions, enter percentage thresholds for each level.Figure: Adding a new scale.
Click Save and Close.
The first scale created is automatically designated for you as the organization default scale applied to every org unit in your organization.
Note: Achievement scale suggestions in quiz questions require the use of a percentage-based scale.  If a non-percentage-based scale is your default, then the achievement scale levels must be manually set by the instructor for each student’s quiz attempt.
The percentage ranges for the levels and the option to map levels to percentage scores cannot be changed after the scale is saved. If these values must be changed, create a new scale and set the new scale to be the default.
Next Steps: After your scale is ready to be used, add some standards to your course.

Mapping outcome levels of achievement to rubric evaluation levels

Levels of achievement in the Brightspace are mapped to rubric levels of evaluation automatically when possible. As a result, when instructors associate outcomes with a rubric criterion, a level of achievement is automatically suggested based on the rubric level of evaluation. The following section of this topic discusses different mapping scenarios you may encounter based on your rubric and scale configuration.
Scenario: Alignment is determined based on scores and aligned to the scale
If the suggested alignment can be determined based on scores and aligned to the scale, then the Brightspace automatically completes this type of alignment. You do not see the colored alignment markers; however, it's possible to display and adjust those markers if necessary. If it's not possible to determine the mapping based on scores, then a best assumption mapping displays and you can confirm or adjust as appropriate.
Scenario: The default achievement scale has percentages and the rubric is points- or custom points-based
If the default achievement scale has percentages and the rubric is either points-based or custom points-based, then the achievement scale levels are automatically mapped based on the scoring percentage for each criterion row. 
Note: Since the percentage value might not align specifically with the evaluation levels of the topic, those mappings do not appear automatically in the edit view of the rubric.  
The Brightspace automatically aligns the mappings based on the point score awarded in the evaluation compared to the percentage thresholds in the scale. However, there is a setting in the Rubric options you can use to display the alignment markers in the rubrics and manually align the markers if necessary. The percentage value may not align specifically with the evaluation levels of the rubric based on the rubric level points. 
Scenario: The default achievement scale does not contain percentages, or the rubric is text-only (No Score)
If the default achievement scale does not contain percentages or the rubric is text-only (No Score), then the achievement level mappings are displayed by default with suggested mapping to the displayed rubric levels. If the same number of levels exist in the achievement scale and the rubric evaluation levels, then Brightspace uses a 1:1 alignment , but you can adjust the level as necessary.
Scenario: There are more rubric levels than achievement levels
If there are more rubric levels than achievement levels, some achievement levels may not be mapped to the rubric. By default, the display distributes the levels symmetrically. The center of both rubrics and achievement outcome levels are automatically mapped, and the levels on each side of the center are distributed equally, as equally and symmetrically as possible. If the default is not appropriate for your implementation, you can make manual adjustments to the alignments. 
In the following example, the achievement scale has 3 levels and the rubric has 4 evaluation levels. The rubric has no score, so the markers appear automatically. The initial suggestion is to map the highest level of the rubric (Exemplary) to the highest level of the scale (the green Mastered achievement level) as well as to align the two lowest levels (the Unsatisfactory rubric level with the Red Not Yet achievement level). The remaining middle achievement level does not fit easily into the two remaining rubric levels. In this example, the suggestion is to align both the Proficient and Limited rubric levels to the blue Got It achievement level. However, it is possible to reposition the marker to create a different alignment if that is more appropriate.

Figure: Create or Edit rubrics dialog enabling instructors to adjust the achievement mapped to the rubric levels.
Scenario: There are more achievement levels than rubric levels
If there are more achievement levels than rubric levels, some achievement levels will not be included in the map. In this case, the top and bottom achievement levels are automatically mapped to the top and bottom rubric levels. Then, the second level from the bottom and second level from the top are dropped, then the fourth level from the bottom and the top are dropped, and so on, until only every other achievement level is mapped to the rubric.
Manually adjusting achievement scale levels mapped to rubrics
After the achievement  scale is mapped to rubric levels in the display, instructors can manually adjust the alignment by dragging the colored circles in the Achievement Levels row of the rubric to identify the desired mapping. Changes can be made to the alignment until a submission is evaluated using the rubric. At that point, rubrics and the mapped  achievement scale are locked to the number of current achievement levels.
Note:  Achievement marker suggestions appear in the create/edit view of the rubric only in specific situations.
To adjust the achievement scale levels mapped to rubrics:
Ensure that there is an achievement scale defined at the organization level and a scale is set as the default.
Ensure that there are learning outcomes created or imported into the course using the Outcomes tool.
From Course Admin, under Assessment, click Rubrics.
From the context menu for your selected rubric, click Edit. Note: There must be at least one standard aligned to at least one rubric criterion row. The rubric selected must not have been previously used to evaluate any learner submitted work. 
If changes are necessary, do one of the following:Click  the circle that delineates the scale level threshold marker and drag it to a new location.Using a keyboard, tab to the circular drag handle to select it, Then, use the left and right arrow keys to move the threshold marker to a new location.
When you have completed the edits to the rubric, click Close.

About Learning Paths

Learning Paths allows organizations to  group and sequence  multiple courses into a sequential, easy-to-follow program to achieve specific learning goals for professional development and continuing education. Learning Paths  help chart a learner's progress  and see their next steps as they move through the courses in a simple interface. 
Each learning path created in Learning Paths is  a unique org unit within Brightspace. 
Learning Paths requires the use of the My Learning widget to provide visibility and access to the learning paths assigned to learners. 
Courses used by Learning Paths require the New Content Experience (Lessons) and the New Learner Experience enabled to track module completion and chart overall progress through an assigned learning path. 
Learning Paths integrates  with the Learning Groups and Manager Dashboard tools for easy assignment and tracking of learning paths that have been assigned to learning groups or direct reports of managers. 
 



--------------------------------------------------


Set up Learning Paths

Learning Paths requirements
Learning Paths requires the following settings and configurations: 
 The New Content Experience (Lessons) and the New Learner Experience configuration variables must be enabled  for each course within a learning path. Any course you add to a learning path must have these settings configured to correctly track module completion within courses as part of the overall progress tracking for Learning Paths. 
                A default learner role is required to enroll all users assigned to learning paths in your organization. If your organization has Manager Dashboard enabled, the learner role you have set for Manager Dashboard is automatically set as the default learner role for Learning Paths. If your organization does not have Manager Dashboard configured, you must set the default learner role using the d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole configuration variable. 
The administrator and learner roles must have specific role permissions to access and use the full functionality of Learning Paths and the My Learning widget.
The My Learning widget must be added to the organization home page for learners to access their learning paths. 
Enable Learning Paths
Before you begin: Ensure you have the permissions to enable tools and access configuration variables for your organization. 
From the Admin Tools menu, click Organization Tools. Turn on  Learning Paths.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Config Variable Browser. Do the following: Navigate to d2l.Tools.Content.IsLessonsEnabled and set to on. Click Save.  Navigate to d2l.Tools.Content.UseLessonsExperience. Click Add Value > Select Org Unit or enter the Org Unit ID. Click Update. Select on from the Value drop-down. Click Save. Repeat these steps for every course that will be added to learning paths using Learning Paths. Navigate to d2l.Tools.Content.NewLearnerExperience. Click Add Value > Select Org Unit or enter the Org Unit ID. Click Update. Select on from the Value drop-down. Click Save. Repeat these steps for every course that will be added to learning paths using Learning Paths. If required, set up the default learner role for Learning Paths. Navigate to d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole configuration variable and edit at the organization level. Click Add Value, and then specify the top-level org unit as the Org Unit ID value and select the learner role as the Role value. 

To allow course administrators to create, edit and assign learning paths to learners, ensure the role has the following permissions: 
Learning Paths > Access Learning Paths  at the Organization level.
 Learning Paths > Manage Learning Paths at the Organization level.
Org Unit Editor > Can Create and Edit Org Units at the Organization level. 

To allow learners to access and complete their assigned courses in Learning Paths and the My Learning widget, ensure the default learner role has the following permissions: Learning Paths > Access Learning Paths at the Organization level.  Content > View Course Content at the Course Offering level and the Learning Path level.
Edit the organization home page and add the My Learning widget.
Edit the organization navbar and add  Learning Paths. 




--------------------------------------------------


Create and Manage Learning Paths

To create a learning path in Learning Paths, you must have the Manage Learning Paths, and Can Create and Edit Org Units permissions at the Org level assigned to your role.
On the navbar, click Learning Paths
Click Create Learning Path
In he Name field, enter a name for the learning path.
In the Description field, add a description for the learning path.
Under Additional Identification, add a unique Learning Path Code.Note: By default, LP appears in the Learning Path Code field. If you delete the learning path code, there cannot be a null value in the field, and it defaults back to LP when you save. 
Click Add Activity to view or search the list of available courses to add to the learning path. Select the courses to add in the order you want them to appear in the learning path. If you want to reorder the courses, you can drag the tiles, or click the ... menu on each tile and select Move Up, Move Down, or Remove.
Click the Visibility toggle to set the learning path to Visible (it is Hidden by default). 
Click Save and Close. 
Assign learning paths to learners with Learning Paths
Assigning a learning path to learners in Learning Paths automatically enrolls the learner into every course within that learning path. You can assign learning paths to learners using the following tools:
•	Learning Groups
•	Users
Note: Automatic enrollment into all courses within a Learning Path can take, at most, 5-10 minutes.
Assign learning paths in Learning Groups
The number of courses within a learning path count towards the 50 total courses that you can assign to a learning group. D2L recommends adding no more than 10 courses to learning paths if you are assigning learning paths using Learning Groups. 
Before you begin: Ensure the learning path(s) you want to assign are Visible to users.
In Learning Groups, click the learning group you want to edit.
From the Learning tab, click Assign Learning. 
Select the check box for the learning path(s) and/or course(s) you want to assign to the group. 
Click Next.
Click Assign Learning. 
Assign learning paths in Users
Before you begin: Ensure you have the required permissions to enroll users into org units in the Users tool. 
From the Admin Tools menu, click Users.

Search for users and select the user(s) you want to assign to learning paths.

Click a user.
Click the Enrollments tab.
In the Search For field, type the learning path you want to enroll the user in or click Search to see all the possible courses.
To ensure the user's role is set to the Learning Paths default learner role, click the Select a new role icon beside the learning path you want to enroll the user in.
Set the user's role to the default learner role from the drop-down list. Click Apply.
Edit a learning path in Learning Paths
Before you begin: To prevent enrollment errors, D2L advises against making changes to the courses in a learning path after  learners have been enrolled and the learning path is set to Visible.
On the navbar, click Learning Paths.
Click the title of the existing learning path you want to edit.
Do any of the following:To change the learning path title or description, click the Name or Description fields.To change the learning path code, under Additional Identification, add a unique Learning Path Code.NOTE: If you delete the learning path code, there cannot be a null value in the field. It automatically defaults back to the last saved Learning Path Code value.To change the visibility of the learning path, click the Visibility toggle.To change the order of courses in the learning path, drag and drop the courses in the order you want them to appear, or click the ... icon and click Move Up or Move Down.To add a course to an existing learning path, click Add Activity and select the course you want to add.To remove a course from the learning path, click the ... icon. Click Remove.
Click Save and Close.
Notes:
Temporarily removing then re-adding a course in a learning path can result in enrollment errors if a learner is assigned to the learning path while the course is removed - the learner will not be enrolled in the course when it is re-added. 
Adding a course to an existing learning path does not auto-enroll the learners assigned to the learning path to that course. You must manually enroll learners into new courses added to existing learning paths. 
Delete a learning path in Learning Paths
Deleting a learning path does not delete the individual courses  within the learning path or remove enrolled learners from the courses in the learning path. If you want to remove users from the courses, you must manually unenroll each learner from each course within the learning path. 
On the navbar, click Learning Paths.
Click the ... icon on the learning path you want to delete. Click Delete. 
Note: Deleted learning paths can be restored from the Recycle Bin in the Org Unit Editor. 
Viewing assigned learning paths in Manager Dashboard
Managers with the Content > View Course Content permission can view the courses from assigned learning paths (assigned to their direct reports/team members via Learning Groups or Users) from the Manager View page in Manager Dashboard. The courses that make up a learning path appear in the Learning Item list on the Learning tab as well as the name of the learning path. 
Notes:
Courses within learning paths that have Course Completion Tracking enabled will display the course progress, but overall learning path progress does not appear. Learning Paths does not track progress using the Course Completion Tracking service; instead learning paths rely on the module completion tracking  that is unique to the New Content Experience (Lessons). 
Currently learning paths cannot be assigned to learners from Manager Dashboard. 
Manage Learning Paths with the My Learning widget
The My Learning Widget displays learning path enrollment and progress for learners and functions as the only access point to assigned learning paths for learners. All active courses assigned to the learner appear in the My Learning widget, and courses that are not part of learning paths. 
Learning paths must be set to Visible in order to appear in the My Learning widget. Courses that are part of hidden learning paths become visible in the Course Selector, the My Learning widget (as individual courses) and in the My Courses widget (if available on the My Home page). 
The My Learning widget depends on filtering that use Brightspace roles to IMS role mapping. You must configure the learner role you intend for users using Learning Paths with the IMS Learner Role to make learning path enrollments appear in the My Learning widget. If you do not have the Learner Role IMS mapping set correctly, learners could see empty My Learning widgets and will have no way to access Learning Paths.
Notes: 
If your organization is using Manager Dashboard, the Manager Dashboard-configured Learner role is automatically set as the default learner role for Learning Paths. Ensure this existing Learner role maps to the IMS standard learner role.
D2L recommends organizations that enable Learning Paths use the My Learning widget in place of the My Courses widget on your organization home page.
Determine the Default Learner Role for Learning Paths
Learning Paths requires all users who will be assigned to learning paths to have one consistent course-level role for your Org. This default learner role  is used to enroll all users into courses within an assigned learning path in Learning Paths.
If your organization has Manager Dashboard configured, Learning Paths automatically uses the same org-level learner role you have set up for use with Manager Dashboard as the default learner role. 
If your organization does not have Manager Dashboard configured, you must set the default learner role for Learning Paths at the Org level, using the d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole configuration variable. 
Note: The Manager Dashboard-configured default Learner role overrides any other learner role you set up with the d2l.System.Enrollment.LearnerRole configuration variable. 
Map the learner role to the standard IMS learner role for the My Learning widget
From the Admin Tools menu, click IMS Configuration. 
Locate the Learner role (used for Manager Dashboard, if applicable). 
In the Context Role column, click on the + Edit Role Mapping link.
In the dialogue, select the Learner mapping.
Click Save.

To enable Turnitin for an assignment, do the following:
From the Assignments tool, click New Assignment.
Give the assignment a name.
Navigate to the Turnitin tab.
Click Enable Turnitin for this folder.
Once enabled, you can continue to create the details for the new assignment, including more options in Turnitin, such as configuring Similarity Report and Online Grading functionalities.
Click Save and Close.




--------------------------------------------------


Sync assignment release conditions with associated grade items

Assignment release conditions can be automatically synced with associated grade items in the new assignment creation experience. This ensures that both items follow the same set of rules and become visible/accessible to learners at the same time. It also removes the need for instructors to manually recreate the release conditions in two locations and makes all aspects of the assessment experience consistent for the learner. Administrators can determine the behavior of assignment release conditions with the d2l.Tools.Grades.ReleaseConditionSync configuration variable. This is an organization level configuration variable; it can’t be set on a course or department level. If the variable is turned on, it is on for all courses.
When the configuration variable is turned on, changes made to the release conditions associated to assignments are transferred to grade items. Once an assignment and grade item have their release conditions linked, there is an information message on the Restrictions tab of the grade item to informs instructors that release conditions are managed by the associated assignment, with a link to the relevant assignment.
After the configuration variable is turned on, new assignments and edited assignments sync their release conditions to the grade item they are associated to. Existing assignments are not retroactively updated. To update existing assignments, instructors can edit and save individual assignments.



--------------------------------------------------


Restore a deleted submission

You must have the See and Manage Assignments and View Submitted Files permissions to view the Submission Log.
Do one of the following:In the context menu for an assignment, click Submission Log.On the Submissions page for an assignment, click Submission Log.
In the entry for the deleted submission, click Restore.

About Awards

The Awards tool enables instructors to provide merit-based awards to students. There are two types of awards: Badges, and Certificates.
Badges are awarded based on any criteria determined by the instructor. They are meant to provide digital markers that represent accomplishment throughout a course or program. Badges do not contribute to achieving a passing grade; however, badges are awarded for achievements that also can contribute to the type of work ethic that results in a passing grade. For example, an instructor might create a badge that is based on posting 15 discussion posts in the first month of a course, or on perfect attendance, or on academic excellence. These items are the types of trends that can help a learner to succeed in a course or program.
Certificates are also awarded based on criteria determined by the instructor. Certificates are similar to Badges, however, they include a PDF that users can print. Certificates typically indicate an official statement of certification or award at the end of a program, but can be awarded during the course for other criteria as well. Certificates can be awarded based on achieving a milestone that a learner can use for further academic or career success, such as passing a practical exam. Certificates also do not contribute to achieving a passing grade.
Note: To prevent plagiarism and protect an organization's intellectual and branding copyrights, all earned certificates downloaded from the Awards tool are password-protected from editing. Each certificate is generated with a random password that is not displayed to users, preventing anyone from editing the certificate in Adobe® Acrobat® or Adobe Reader®. This makes it unnecessary to manually add password-protection to uploaded certificates.
Badges and Certificates can be automatically awarded based on release condition criteria, or can be manually awarded.



--------------------------------------------------


Set up Awards

The Awards tool is, by default, turned on at the system level  but turned off at the organization level. You must turn on the tool at the organization level for the Awards tool to appear on your navbar.

Manage Award icons and templates

Add new icons to the Award Icon Library
The Award Icon Library contains icons that you can use to create Badges. A default library of badge icons is available with the Awards tool. You can delete these default icons or add new icons to the library. 
Within the course, on the navbar, click Awards.
Click Award Icon Library.
Click Upload New Icon.
Browse to the location of the image file that you want to upload.
Click Open.
Add new Certificate Templates
The Awards tool contains a default certificate template. You can delete this default template or add new templates to the repository. You can also edit an existing template.
Within the course, on the navbar, click Awards.
Click Certificate Templates.
Click Upload New Template.
Browse to the location of the new template.
Click Open.
Create new Certificate Templates
If the default templates provided with Awards do not meet your needs, you can create your own certificate templates from which administrators or instructors can create certificates for their courses.
Note: To prevent plagiarism and protect an organization's intellectual and branding copyrights, all earned certificates downloaded from the Awards tool are password-protected from editing. Each certificate is generated with a random password that is not displayed to users, preventing anyone from editing the certificate in Adobe® Acrobat® or Adobe Reader®. This makes it unnecessary to manually add password-protection to uploaded certificates.
Using an application, such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, or Adobe Acrobat Professional, create a form.
Add images, branding, and static text to complete your default design.
Save the form as a PDF document. 
Open the PDF file (in Adobe Acrobat for example) and create a new PDF form based on the PDF you opened.
Add text boxes to the PDF to include the content that you want on your completed Certificate.
Map the text boxes and their corresponding tooltip boxes to the txtBox Name using supported text strings. Text strings are automatically replaced with user, course, and award values when you generate the certificate. Supported text strings include: {CourseStartDate} {CourseEndDate} {CourseName}{UserFirstName} {UserLastName} {UserEmail} {UserName}{FullName} {OrgDefinedID} {OrgUnitCode} {AwardDate} {AwardExpiryDate} {AwardName} {AwardDescription} {AwardEvidence} {IssuerName} {IssuerContact} {AwardCreditValue}
Ensure that each text box is large enough for any replacement text (such as the hyphenated last name of a learner, or a multi-sentence description of an award). Ensure that only one replace string is added to each text box. 
Enable Word Wrap so that the text is not cut off, and the text that you want for each text box appears as expected.
In Brightspace, access the course, in which you want to create certificate templates.
Navigate to the Awards tool and click Certificate Templates.

About the Awards Leaderboard widget

The Awards Leaderboard is a customizable system widget that can be added to the homepages of course offerings. It displays the top 10 users who have earned badges (not certificates) in the course. Course administrators with permissions can configure the Awards leaderboard to display the learners with either the highest Number of Awards or Credits appearing at the top. Learners with the same number of awards falling within the top 10 grouping are sorted by name in alphabetical order. If no learner in the course has an award, the Awards Leaderboard widget appears in empty state. 
Learner names may appear as 'Anonymous User' if a user's role is restricted from seeing first and or last names via User Information Privacy settings. A learner's preferred name setting may appear if enabled for the learner.
Enabling the Awards Leaderboard widget
The Awards Leaderboard tool  is available for organizations that have previously purchased Course Adventure Pack or that are currently running Engagement Plus.  Organization Administrators can enable the Awards Leaderboard widget in Organization Tools and add the widget to any course or shared homepage.

Auditors and Bulk Auditor Management
An auditor in Brightspace is a user with permission to see (audit) another user's information. This feature is useful if you want to grant access to someone who can view and monitor the learner in a specific course offering; for example, parents of learners or instructor assistants.
User auditors don't have to have their own role in the organization. You must decide how much visibility you want auditors to have in the classlist, or what tools you want them to have access to. Their access can also depend on the relationship of the auditors to the users they audit.
Before you begin
Roles that manage users must have the following permission in order to manage auditor-user relationships: 

Users Auditors > Manage Auditors

In addition, the following permissions are advised:

Users > See the User Management tool (for Administrators)


Classlist > Has Access to the Classlist and the appropriate Users > Search For {RoleName} permissions (for Instructors)

Enable auditors in your instance
Set the User Auditors > Audit Users permissions for the user auditor's role.
Watch how to assign an auditor

Available Actions for Bulk Auditor Management
Bulk Auditor Management allows you to enroll or unenroll multiple auditors by uploading a comma-separated CSV file. This file must be in .txt format.
You can perform the following actions:

CREATE,AuditorUsername,UserToAuditUsername


REMOVE,AuditorUsername,UserToAuditUsername


REMOVE,AuditorUsername,*


REMOVE,*,UserToAuditUsername

AuditorUsername is the username for the auditor.
UserToAuditUsername is the username for the user to be audited.
An asterisk (*) is used to match all users who are either an auditor for a user or audited by a user.
RestrictedbyOrgUnitId API  
The RestrictedbyOrgUnitId API allows users to create groups out of users within a specific section or group in a course.

About Video Note

Video Note enables you to insert video recordings through Brightspace Editor's Insert Stuff option, and anywhere video attachments are supported (Content, Discussions, Grading, providing feedback to learners, and Activity Feed). 
The ability to insert, upload, and administer Video Notes is controlled by Media Platform permissions set by your administrator. For example, if a user does not have the Can Upload Video Notes permission, the Add Video Note option does not display when using Insert Stuff to add a Video Note.
Note: If you have permissions to access Video Note Search, you can also search and insert video notes made by you and other users.



--------------------------------------------------


Purge video notes

Video Note Data Purge is now completed through the Content Service data purge system.

About Course Templates

All courses offered in Brightspace must be associated with a course template. Course templates link a course offering to a department (or another parent org unit for organizations that don't use departments or include another org unit between departments and course templates).
The primary purpose of the template org unit is to act as a container that groups similar or related courses together: for example, all History 101 courses could be associated with one parent History 101 course. This is useful for enrollment, course creation, and administration of courses over time.
The course template could also act as a library for child org units. Template components and settings are not automatically inherited by child org units; however, they can be shared or copied over to course offerings. The connection between a template and a course offering also allows some tool items to be shared from a template to a course offering, such as: themes, navigation, links, link groups, competencies, rubrics, remote plugins, external learning tools (ELTs), and ePortfolio forms. However, tool items can only be managed from the template.
Important: Although it is possible to use the template as a library for child org units, this often requires additional enrollment steps and administrative overhead, since course templates cannot be easily accessed from the course selector or My Courses widget. Therefore, setting up a "Master Course" course offering org unit is recommended for this purpose.
You can attach multiple course offerings to a template. All course offerings attached to a template belong to the same department, since it is the template, not the course offering that is associated with a department.
There are three different ways to create course offerings and templates:
You can manually create them through the D2L course creation interface.
You can use batch course creation to automatically create course offerings based on entries in a CSV file.
You can integrate with a learner information system (SIS/UIS).
Best practices for using course templates
All course offerings must be associated with a course template. 
Each course should have a single template but may have multiple offerings (one offering for each class or session). 
Any time you have two course offerings that you would describe as "the same course," they should share a single template. 
Tools and content that are reused every time the course is offered should be stored inside the course template. 
Components can be customized inside a particular course offering without affecting the template or future offerings. 
Good ideas from a course offering can easily be copied to the template and integrated into future offerings of the course. 
Create a new templateWhen creating a new course, begin by creating the course template alone. It is easier to create the course’s first offering after you have configured the course template.Give the template the name and code, (for example, Introduction to Science and Technology, ST100). This will help reinforce the idea that the template contains the standard configuration for the course.Use a file path that stores template files in a root folder and course offering files in folders below the template. Consider using something like:/content/department/course (template)/course session (course offering)/content/Science and Technology/ST100/ST100_Fall2012
Configure course components inside the templateCourse components include any course content, grade book setup, release conditions, discussion topics, question libraries, etc. you want to use within your course.You should configure course components that will be the same for all offerings of a course inside the template. You can copy components from other templates or previous course offerings if you want to reuse configurations from other courses. You can also import components from a file.
Create a course offeringOnce the master copy of the course has been set up inside the course template, you are ready to create the first course offering. When creating the first course offering, choose the option to create a new course offering based on the template you created.For the course offering name, use the name of the course plus a session indicator (for example, Introduction to Science and Technology Fall 2012). For the code, use the course code plus an indicator (for example, ST100_Fall2012).Remember to use a course path that incorporates the appropriate department and template in the following format: /content/department/course (template)/course session (course offering). For example, /content/Science and Technology/ST100/ST100_Fall2012.
Copy all components from the template to the course offeringAfter creating the course offering, click the Copy or Import Course Components link on the Summary page to open the Import/Export/Copy Components page for the new course offering. Select the items in the template that you want to copy into the course offering.
Activate the course homepage and navigation bar and enable toolsThe new offering uses the organization’s default navbar, homepage and tool settings. If you copy a homepage or navbar from the template, you need to activate them. If you copy tools that are not enabled by default, you need to enable these tools in the new offering.
Best practices for creating a standard setup for an existing course
If you have already been using Brightspace without maintaining standard course components within course templates, it is easy to establish standard configurations for your existing courses.
Apply a standard naming conventionHaving a standard naming convention will help you to think of the course template as the master copy of the course. This is particularly important if you have not been using a single course template with multiple course offerings for each course in the past.Take the template used with the most recent offering of the course and change its name to the name of the course (e.g. Introduction to Science and Technology).Take the most recent course offering and change its name to the name of the course plus some indication of the session, class, or term (e.g. Introduction to Science and Technology Fall 2012). Use the same strategy in naming all future offerings of the same course.
Use a standard convention for file pathsWhen creating or configuring course components, you will often have to work with the directory structure on your file server (using the File Manager). Having the paths for your course template and each of your course offerings in order will make these tasks easier.For the course template, consider using:/content/department/course (template)/content/Science_and_Technology/ST100/For each course offering, consider using:/content/department/course (template)/session (course offering)//content/Science_and_Technology/ST100/ST100_Fall2012/This construction will help you to conceptually separate the standard components for the course (stored in the template) from individual course offerings.
Create the standard course setup inside the course templateBegin by copying the components from the most recent offering of the course, as these will usually be closest to what you want to use as your standard components in the future. (In some cases an older offering or even an offering from another course might be closer to what you want. Or you might want to copy individual components from multiple sources.)You can also add additional elements to components you have copied, reorganize the configuration of the components, and, where necessary, configure empty components and create new course materials.
Create a new course offering based on the updated templateOnce the template’s configuration is finalized, you are ready to create a new course offering based on the course’s standard configuration.
Reasons to use course templates
The advantage of using a course template to store the standard setup of the course is that you keep a master copy of the course components separate from the individual course offerings. This leaves you free to customize the course for each individual class without affecting the next offering. Course templates are not ideal for all situations. The following table is intended as a guide to help you determine which components, if any, you should store inside a course template.

If


You should


Your course offerings are all unique and you never offer the same course twice


Create a single empty template for each course offering (to link the course offering to a department or other parent org unit)
Create and configure components inside the course offering


You re-offer the same course in different semesters and reuse the same tools, files, and content


Build and store standard components inside the course template
Copy standard components into course offerings when the course is re-offered


You mainly reuse course content (rather than the other tools), and mix-and-match content across different course


Use the Brightspace Learning Repository to store, share and reuse course content
Or
Use the Copy Components feature to copy content directly between course offerings

What you can store in a template
You can store almost any component that can be added to a course offering inside a course template so that it may be reused for multiple offerings of the same course.
The following components can be created, modified, and stored inside a course template:
Assignments
Attendance Registers
Calendar Events
Checklist
Competencies
Content
Course Files
Discussions
External Links
FAQs
Glossary
Grades
Groups
Homepages
Navigation Bars
Announcements
Question Library
Registration Forms
Rubrics
Calendar
Self Assessments
Tool Display Names
Widgets
External Learning Tool Links
External Learning Tool Providers
You can also maintain Quicklinks between components, release conditions, and links between your grade book and other tools.
What is the difference between sharing and copying course components?
Some tools allow you to share specific items across multiple course offerings. The Rubrics tool, for example, allows you to configure individual rubric to be shared with all course offerings (or specific ones) beneath the org unit in which the rubric is created.
You can use this feature to automatically use a particular rubric in every course offering attached to a specific template. When a new offering is created, the rubric is automatically available as long as the offering is associated with the appropriate template.
By sharing the rubric, you don’t have to manually copy it into the course offering each time you add a course offering to the template; and any changes you make to the rubric appear in all course offerings.
These tools can be shared across org units:

Set up templates

Configure template components
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Course Management.
On the Manage Courses page, click the Templates tab.
In the Search For field, type part of the template name or code, then click Search.
Click the template name.
On the Course Administration page, click  Import/Export/Copy components.
Select Copy Components from Another Org Unit > Start.
Click the Edit icon beside the component you want to configure.
Configure the component. Each course component has a unique configuration interface.
When you finish configuring the component, close the new browser window or tab.
Copy or import components into a template
You can import components into a course template from a supported file type, or copy components from a course offering or another template. Copying standard course components from a course offering back into a template ensures that your template is up to date and helps you maintain a consistent approach to the creation of course offerings and consistent course content over time.
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Course Management.
On the Manage Courses page, in the Templates tab, enter the template name or code in the Search For field and click Search.
Click on the template name.
On the navbar, click  Course Admin >  Import/Export/Copy components.
Select Import Components or Copy Components from Another Org Unit.
If you select Import Components, select from a file and click Browse to locate your import file.
Click Start to begin the wizard. Follow the directions on the page to finish importing or copying components to the template.
Edit the components inside a course template
Components are the resources used to teach a course, such as discussions forums, assignment submissions folders, quizzes, content topics, checklists, etc. You can configure and store most components inside a course template, which you can use as a master copy of your course by copying these components into new course offerings each time the course is offered.
You can make changes to any of the template’s components at any time without affecting existing course offerings. The updated components can then be copied into future course offerings.
If you want template changes to be incorporated into an existing course offering, you need to copy the updated components manually. Make sure you only copy the individual items that you want to update (e.g., individual quizzes, assignment submissions folders, discussion topics, etc.), copying an entire tool may cause unwanted changes.
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Course Management.
Click the Templates tab.
Use the Search For field to find your template name or code.
Click on the template you want to edit.
On the navbar, click  Course Admin >  Import/Export/Copy components.
Select Copy Components from Another Org Unit
Click Start.
On the Copy Course Components page, click the Edit icon next to the component you want to configure. 
Configure the component. Each course component has its own unique configuration interface. 
When you finish configuring the component, close the new browser window or tab.
Adding a course image  to a new course template
Although you cannot directly add an image to a course template, you can import an image from an existing course into the course template. After you have created a course that includes the image you want to use, you can use the Copy Components function to add the image to your course template.
Note: To add a course image, you require the Change Course Image and Banner Text permission at the course template level. If you do not have this permission,  the Course Image and Banner Text checkbox does not appear.
Create a new template and select Add Components to the new template. 
Click Search for offering to find the course where the component image currently resides.

Select a course offering from the drop-down list or click Search For Offering.
Click Next.
Enter information about the new template, then click Next.
If you chose to create a course offering, add information about the new course offering, then click Next.
Click Create.
If you created a course offering and selected the Registration check box, complete the following steps on the appropriate pages:On the Registration Info page, enter registration information.Set the registration restriction.Choose your registration form.
Continue making changes to your course offering or template on the Summary page, or click Done.
Watch how to create a course offeringActivate a course offering
Activating a course makes the course appear in the registered learner's My Courses widget. Activating a course also makes it available to learners if you have not set a Start Date or End Date for your course. 
If you set a Start Date for your course that is later than the day you activate your course, the course appears in the My Courses widget, but is not available to learners until the date specified.
If you set an End Date for your course and do not deactivate your course, after that specified date passes, the course remains visible in the My Courses widget, but is not available to learners.
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Course Management.
Search for the course offering name.
Click the course offering you want to deactivate.
On the navbar, click  Course Admin > Course Offering Information.
Select the Course is active check box.Tip: You can deactivate a course offering to hide it from learners without actually deleting it. This way the content (including user data) can be kept for future use.
Click Save.
Deactivate a course offering

Re-offering a course
Once you have the master copy of a course set up inside a course template, there are two options you can choose when creating new course offerings for that course:
Create a new course offering based on an existing template
Re-offer a course offering by choosing a previous version of that course offering
The advantage to re-offering a previous offering is that the course homepage and navbar from the selected offering are automatically copied into the new offering and activated. This saves you from having to copy them from the template. The disadvantage to re-offering a course offering is that any customizations from the template that were made in the offering will be copied. If you choose to re-offer a previous offering, the new course offering’s Name, Code, Language and Path fields are filled by default with the properties from the previous offering. However, we recommend that you modify the Name, Code, and Path fields so they are unique for each offering.
Delete course offerings
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Course Management.
To find the course offering you want to delete, in the Offerings tab, enter a course name in the Search For field. 
Select the check boxes beside the course offerings you want deleted.
Click Delete Selected.

Administer course templates and offerings

Types of course template properties
Course Template Code - A short form for the template name, used to differentiate it from other templates. For example, in the case of Introduction to Science and Technology, "ST100" could be used.
Course Template Name - The full, recognizable name of the course the template is used for. For example, "Introduction to Science and Technology" or "Principles of Accounting."
Course Template Path - The location on the server where files associated with the template are stored. You can type the path into the field or click Browse to navigate the server’s directory structure and select a folder. The path length is limited to 230 characters. The path should be unique; using the same path as another course template or course offering might cause files to be overwritten.
Department - The department through which the course is offered. The selected department will automatically be associated with all course offerings attached to this template. (Your institution might use another term in place of department.) 
Course offering properties
Active - Controls whether the course is currently active (available to users). Inactive courses are normally visible only to system administration. This setting is independent from the course offering’s start and end dates.
Content Sandboxing - Controls whether an HTML file executes scripts (such as JavaScript) within an iFrame only,  preventing them from executing outside the iframe (against the domain).
Course Address Book - Controls whether the course offering is listed as a filter option in the Email inbox and address book. When selected, this setting allows users enrolled in the course offering to easily email other users in the course and in their course groups and section.
Course Offering Code - A short form for the course offering name, used to differentiate it from other course offerings. For example, Introduction to Science and Technology might use "ST100_Fall2012."
Course Offering Name - The full, recognizable name of the course plus the session (term, semester, etc.) in which it is offered. For example, “Introduction to Science and Technology Fall 2012” or “Principles of Accounting (W06).” Used throughout Brightspace wherever courses are listed.
Course Offering Path - The location on the server where files associated with the course offering are stored. You can type the path into the field or click Browse to navigate the server’s directory structure and select a folder. The path length is limited to 230 characters. Using the same path as another course offering or course template can cause files to be overwritten.
Course Template Code - The code your organization uses to identify the course offering’s parent template.
Course Template Name - The name of the course offering’s parent template.
Dark Color - Color for widgets and title background. White text appears on Dark Color areas.
Department - The department the course offering’s parent template is associated with. Changing the department affects all other course offerings associated with the same template.
Description - A description of the course offering.
End Date - The date when the course offering closes. Users cannot access the course offering after this date without the appropriate permissions.
Force Language - When selected, the course language overrides user language preferences.
Has Sections - Controls whether the course offering has multiple sections. If the check box is not visible, you can add it to the page through Form Elements > CourseOfferingInfo > HasSections.
Language - The language the course uses. All text in the interface is displayed in this language.
Light Color - Seldom used color option. White text appears on Light Color area. We suggest setting this to the same color as the Dark Color.
Registration - Opens the course for self-registration.
Semester - The semester in which the course offering is offered. Your institution might use an alternate name (e.g., term, session).
Soft Color - Color setting used for tabs. Black text is used with Soft Color areas.
Start Date - The date the course offering opens. Users cannot access the course before this date without the appropriate permissions.
About SIS integration
If your D2L system is integrated with an external Student Information System (SIS/UIS), the integration service likely creates new course offerings automatically when it imports courses from the SIS. You can still use course templates to configure and store the standard components of a course; you simply need to map incoming courses to their corresponding course templates. When data is imported from an SIS, it is first moved into Holding Tank where you can view it and manually prepare it for integration into Brightspace. It is in this stage of the integration process that incoming course offerings can be linked to existing course templates.
To map a course to the correct template, use the Course Mapping tool to locate the course in Holding Tank, and then enter the template code for the appropriate template.
For example, say you have a course called Introduction to Science and Technology with the template code (specified when the template is created) “ST100.” When importing new data from the SIS, you would locate the Introduction to Science and Technology course using the Course Mapping Tool and enter “ST100” as the Template Code for this incoming course. The integration service would then create a new course offering in Learning Environment and associate it with the Introduction to Science and Technology course template. You could then copy the course’s standard components from the course template into the new course offering.
All SIS logs are available in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) format.
For more information about SIS Integration, see Holding Tank – Administrator Guide.

Set up a course offering to manage Bulk Course Export

If you want to enable users in your organization who do not have direct access to your file server to add input files to the bulk course tools, you can set up a course offering shell to provide access to the inbox and outbox folders through Brightspace.
Enrolling users into the course shell will enable them to gain access to the inbox location.
You do this by creating a new course offering and then, in Bulk Tool Configuration, setting the Inbox Path and Outbox Path to subfolders of the course offering path. For example, if your Course Offering Path is \content\enforced\138731-BCE then your inbox folder is \content\enforced\138731-BCE\Inbox and your outbox folder is \content\enforced\138731-BCE\Outbox\.
Note: If you have set the d2l.Tools.CMS.CoursePathEnforced configuration variable to Off, you can customize the course offering path. If you customize the course offering path, the bulk export folders must still be located under the organization’s \content\ directory.
Create a Bulk Course Export course shell
From the Admin Tools menu, click Course Management.
On the Manage Courses page, click Create a New Course Offering or Template.
If you already have a generic support or system template for course offerings that are used for purposes other than teaching, complete the following actions:Choose the Create a new course offering based on an existing template option.Select the template from the drop-down list or click Search for template to locate the template on a search page.Click Next.
If you do not already have an appropriate template, complete the following actions:Choose the Create a new course template and a new course offering that has never been offered before option and then click Next.On the Enter Template Information page, enter a Course Template Name and Course Template Code. For example, enter “System” for both the name and code.Click the New Department option and fill in the Name and Code fields, or select a suitable department that already exists.Click Next.
On the Enter Course Information page, enter the Course Offering Name and the Course Offering Code. For example, Bulk Course Export and BCE.
Click Create.
After the course is created, click Modify the new course offering. 
Make note of the Course Offering Path. In Bulk Tool Configuration, you configure the inbox and outbox paths as subfolders of this path.

About Duplicate Calendar Item and LTI checks
When copying or importing a course offering, Copy Course bulk checks Calendar Events and LTI links to prevent creating duplicate events or links. Specifically:

Calendar events that have an association, such as to an activity that is being copied into the course offering; or a single unique Calendar event that is manually created.


LTI links that have a resource code associated, i.e. LTI links that are used in quicklinks or grades; and any unused LTI links. Only a single copy is copied.

When a user manually creates multiple calendar items, Brightspace compares the following fields when checking for duplicates:

Title


Description


Start Date (or Start Day for All Day Events)


End Date (or End Day for All Day Events)

Copy course components using Bulk Tool Configuration

Using Bulk Tool Configuration, you can indicate the course components that you want to copy. These settings are used when you run the Copy Course Bulk process.
Bulk Tool Configuration appears in the Admin Tools menu after you enable Copy Course Bulk and have the Manage Settings permission for at least one bulk tool.
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Bulk Tool Configuration > Course Copy Bulk.
Do one or more of the following:Verify that the Inbox Path shows the location where you want to place the input CSV file. Verify that the Outbox Path shows the location where you want the CSV file to move to on completion. If no paths currently exist, click Change Path to browse to the appropriate directory path locations.
If you want to specify the semester in which to create the courses, select a semester from the list. This value is used if no value or an invalid value is specified in the CSV file.
Select the course settings that you want to copy to the new course or select all settings.
Click Save.
Specify course offerings to copy
You can specify the course offerings to be copied in one or more CSV files located in the inbox folder. Unless you configure the tool to leave the CSV file in the inbox folder, after the Copy Course Bulk processes a CSV file, it moves the file to the outbox folder.
Each line in the CSV file after the header row represents one course offering to copy.
The CCB process appends copied course components to target destination courses and does not overwrite existing components (i.e. anything in the database, such as Activities, Grades, Content, etc.) in the destination course. However course files stored in the Manage Files area are overwritten in the destination course if they already exist.
You can specify the following values for each course:

Field


Description


Source Course Code or Org Unit ID


The course code or Org Unit ID number for the course offering. Displayed on the Org Unit Editor page (the ID appears in parentheses beside the course offering’s name). Also displayed in the browser address bar when a course offering is accessed (required).


New Course Name


The name for the new course.


New Course Code


The course code for the new course. 
This value can match an existing course. If you select the Make copy if course code exists option in Bulk Tool Configuration and this value matches an existing course, Copy Course Bulk makes a copy of the course.


Course Template Code


The code of the template to use for the new course. This template must exist.


Semester Code


The OrgUnitCode of the semester in which to create the course. If this value is omitted, the semester from Bulk Tools Configuration is used. 

Day Offset

The number of days to offset the dates on all activities copied into the new course. Enter a positive integer to move forward and a negative integer to move backward in time. If you want to offset the activity dates without entering a Semester Code, specify an empty string in the Semester Code column.
Note: This column is optional. If no value is entered, activities of the new course retain the dates copied from the source course.

Hour Offset

The number of hours to offset the source course time settings. The number of hours to offset the time of day on all activities copied into the new course. Enter a positive decimal to move forward and a negative decimal to move backward. If you want to offset the time of day on activities without entering a Semester Code or Day Offset, specify an empty string in the Semester Code column and an empty string for the Day Offset column.
Note: If no value is entered, activities in the new course retain the time of day copied from the source course.

This sample CSV file could be used to copy four courses.Source Course Code or OrgUnit ID,New Course Name,New Course Code,Course Template Code,Semester Code,Day Offset,Hour Offset6616,CCB Course 030,CCB_030,IMPORT TEMPLATE,FA2009,120,21603,Calculus III (Winter 2008),Math309_W08,IMPORT TEMPLATE,2256,Calculus I (Winter 2008),Math117_W08,IMPORT TEMPLATE,1827,Linear Algebra III (Winter 2008),Math308_W08,IMPORT TEMPLATE,
Note: The CCB process appends copied course content to target destination courses and does not overwrite existing components in the destination course.

Set up a course offering to manage Copy Course Bulk

If you want to enable users in your organization who do not have direct access to your file server to add course offerings to the bulk course tools, you can set up a course offering shell to provide access to the inbox and outbox folders through Brightspace.
Enrolling users into the course shell will enable them to gain access to the inbox location.
You do this by creating a new course offering and then, in Bulk Tool Configuration, setting the Inbox Path and Outbox Path to subfolders of the course offering path. For example, if your Course Offering Path is \content\enforced\138731-CCB then your inbox folder is \content\enforced\138731-CCB\Inbox and your outbox folder is \content\enforced\138731-CCB\Outbox\.
Note: If you have set the d2l.Tools.CMS.CoursePathEnforced configuration variable to Off, you can customize the course offering path. If you customize the course offering path, the bulk export folders must still be located under the organization’s \content\ directory.
Create a Copy Course Bulk course shell
From the Admin Tools menu, click Course Management.
On the Manage Courses page, click Create a New Course Offering or Template.
If you already have a generic support or system template for course offerings that are used for purposes other than teaching, complete the following actions:Choose the Create a new course offering based on an existing template option.Select the template from the drop-down list or click Search for template to locate the template on a search page.Click Next.
If you do not already have an appropriate template, follow these steps:Choose the option Create a new course template and a new course offering that has never been offered before and then click Next.On the Enter Template Information page, enter a Course Template Name and Course Template Code. For example, enter “System” for both the name and code.Click the option New Department and fill in the Name and Code fields, or select a suitable department.Click Next.
On the Enter Course Information page, enter the Course Offering Name and the Course Offering Code. For example, Copy Course Bulk and CCB.
Click Create.
After the course is created, click Modify the new course offering. 
Make note of the Course Offering Path. In Bulk Tool Configuration, you configure the inbox and outbox paths as subfolders of this path.
From the course selector, open the bulk course offering.
In the Course Administration widget, click Manage Files.
Create the inbox and outbox folders:Click New Folder, type Inbox as the folder name, and then click Save.Click New Folder, type Outbox as the folder name, and then click Save.
Configure the inbox and outbox paths, by completing the following actions:From the Admin Tools menu, click Bulk Tool Configuration > Bulk Course Copy.In the Inbox Path section, click Change Path and then browse to the inbox path under the course offering path. For example, /content/enforced/138731-CCB/Inbox.In the Outbox Path section, click Change Path and then browse to the outbox path under the course offering path. For example, /content/enforced/138731-CCB/Outbox.Click Save.
Grant users access to the course shell
The following permissions enable users to specify courses to copy when the next scheduled task runs by uploading CSV files to the inbox folder using the Manage Courses tool inside the course offering.
Note: Enrolling users into the course shell enables them to gain access to the inbox location.
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Roles and Permissions.

In the Course Administration widget, click Manage Files.
To add course offerings to the copy process, click the Inbox folder and then click Upload to upload the CSV file listing the course offerings.
After the scheduled task runs, confirm that the course offerings were copied successfully. You will encounter an error if one or more course offerings are not copied.
Access the View Copy Course History page
The View Copy Course History page displays the history of course copying events in Brightspace. You can filter the events by Source course, Destination course and by Date Range. The page displays all successful and unsuccessful course copy events according to the criteria selected. Users may also download the results of the query as a .txt file. 
From the  Admin Tools menu, click View Copy Course History.
Bulk Course Copy Workflow
The Bulk Course Copy workflow starts by processing each line in the CSV file and creating the corresponding course offering. The log file contains a block for each line in the CSV and indicates if the course was successfully created or if an error occurred when attempting to read the line.
Sample Log File for CCB
 Bulk Course Copy generates logs only if an input file is processed.
Below is an example of a CCB log file showing the successful creation of a course offering. In this block, you can see that a new course offering with the Org Unit ID 54321 was successfully created.			INFO  2023-05-17 18:05:37 - Started processing files for organization with id '6606'.			INFO  2023-05-17 18:05:37 - Started processing file '[org: 6606; location: \\fs-LVU\LVU\web\content\LVU\BulkTools\CCB\Inbox\Sample CCB.csv]'			INFO  2023-05-17 18:05:37 - Started processing line with number '1' for ‘Sample CCB.csv' file.

INFO  2023-05-17 18:05:38 - 			INFO  2023-05-17 18:05:38 - Finished processing file '[org: 6606; location: \\fs-LVU\LVU\web\content\LVU\BulkTools\CCB\Inbox\Sample CCB.csv]'			INFO  2023-05-17 18:05:38 - Finished processing files for organization with id '6606'.
Post-Processing Action
Once each line has been processed and the course offerings created, the next step is the creation of Copy Jobs to copy the content from the source course to the destination.  The creation of the job does not indicate that the copy is complete but rather that the copy action has been placed in a queue for processing.
This example CCB log shows the post-processing portion of the bulk copy.  This block of the log indicates that a copy job has been created and identifies the source and destination course.INFO  2023-01-13 20:19:52 - Started post-processing files for organization with id '6606'.INFO  2023-01-13 20:19:52 - Creating job to copy from 7009 to 7011INFO  2023-01-13 20:19:52 - Job was successfully created, to see the results go to the Copy History for OrgUnitId 7011
Once all copy jobs have been created the CCB scheduled task will be complete but the action of copying the content to the new courses will continue to run in the background.  You can view the status of the copy job in the Copy Course History page of the Admin Tools Menu or in the Copy Course Components History page of the specific course offering.

About Duplicate Calendar Item and LTI checks
When copying or importing a course offering, Copy Course bulk checks Calendar Events and LTI links to prevent creating duplicate events or links. Specifically:

Calendar events that have an association, such as to an activity that is being copied into the course offering; or a single unique Calendar event that is manually created.


LTI links that have a resource code associated, such as LTI links that are used in quicklinks or grades; and any unused LTI links. Only a single copy is copied.

When a user manually creates multiple calendar items, Brightspace compares the following fields when checking for duplicates:

Title


Description


Start Date (or Start Day for All Day Events)


End Date (or End Day for All Day Events)


All Day EventRepeat frequency (for example, every day, every second month)

Set up course navbars and themes

For each course, you can create a navbar with links to course-specific and organization-wide tools and resources, and a theme to customize and brand the look and feel of navbars and page backgrounds.
Set a default navbar
You must have permission to manage navbars at the organization level to set default navbars for an org unit and its child org units.
From the  Admin Tools menu, click Navigation & Themes > Navbars.
From the context menu of the navbar you want to set as the default navbar for the org unit and its child org units, click Set as the default.
Create a theme
Themes enable you to customize and apply branding to navbars and page backgrounds. Themes do not control the type of links navbars can contain. When you create a theme, there are two colors in the theme you can configure to ensure a consistent user experience and adhere to your organization's branding guidelines:
Primary Color: Modifies the background of the link area in the navbar and units in Lessons (each lesson and folder in a unit displays the same color, only lighter), if enabled.
Accent Color: Modifies the thin color strip above the navbar.
Notes:
If the Primary Color is not specified, the default colour scheme is used in New Conent Experience (Lessons).
 All themes listed on the Themes page at the course offering level contain information about whether a theme is shared from another org unit and the name of the org unit sharing the theme.
If your permissions do not allow you to create themes, you must select from existing themes or use the default theme.Themes created in an org unit are automatically shared with child org units.
Themes created at the course level cannot be shared with other courses. However, you can create and store them inside a course template to make them available in course offerings that use the course template.
The Theme Preview area displays changes as you make them.
To create a theme
On the navbar, click Course Admin.
Click Navigation & Themes > Themes
Click Create Theme.
Enter a Name and Description for your theme.
To apply a Logo to your theme, do one of the following:Drag-and-drop an image file into the corresponding area, and click UploadClick Choose Existing to apply an image that is already uploaded to Brightspace.Note: SVG files are recommended for better scaling. The logo can be a maximum of 260 x 60 pixels, but displays at smaller sizes for viewing on mobile devices or when viewing a navbar with a course title.
Choose a Primary Color to modify the background of the link area in the navbar and units in New Content Experience (Lessons). Each lesson and folder in a unit displays the same color.
Choose an Accent Color to modify the thin color strip above the navbar.
Click the context menu and select the correct destination from the options in the menu to customize the link destination.
Click Save and Close.
Your new theme is created. To make your theme the default theme for your course, click the context menu next to your theme and select Make Default.
Applying an org unit name to a navbar
In addition to the logo, you can configure the org unit name to appear, except on the org navbar (which always hides the name), and course navbar (which always shows the name).  
To include the org unit name in the navbar:
From the Admin Tools menu, click Navigation and Themes.
Click Themes.
Click the current theme.
In the Name field, enter the org unit name.
Set a default theme
You must have permission to manage themes at the organization level to set default themes for an org unit and its child org units.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Navigation & Themes > Themes.
From the context menu of the theme you want to make the default theme for an org unit and its child org units, click Set as the default.

About Manage Files

The Manage Files tool is a file management system for your course. You can use this tool to organize and upload files associated with your course offering. D2L recommends that you organize your files into folders, creating a folder for each module of content. 
In some instances, when you upload .jpg files in any file upload area across Brightspace, an EXIF (exchangeable image file) data warning appears informing the user that the file may contain geolocation data.
About Organization Files
Moving, deleting, or renaming files or folders may cause problems in course offerings that use those files or folders. Ensure that you update the course offering or template path within a course offering or template after you edit files or folders.
You can use Organization Files to manage the files and the directory structure inside of the content file directory (/content/). This is a separate file directory from the /shared/ directory. Each course offering and template has its own sub-directory under the content root. When users upload or access files from the content directory within a course offering or template, they only have access to the sub-directory for that org unit. They do not have access to the rest of the structure or the root. The /content/ directory is typically used to store files related to specific course offerings and templates, including content topics and Announcements posting files.
About Public Files
Warning: Since user authentication is not necessary to access files stored in the Public Files directory, D2L strongly recommends that you do not store sensitive, private, or confidential information in this location.
Public files can be viewed by anyone outside of your organization. Users with the Browse Public Files permission can view the Public Files area as an option when adding files to Content or other locations in the Brightspace.
Users with the Upload/Edit/Delete Public Files permission can add files into the Public Files area and can edit or delete existing files.
In some instances, when you upload .jpg files in any file upload area across Brightspace, an EXIF (exchangeable image file) data warning appears informing the user that the file may contain geolocation data.

About Course Updater

Administrators can use the Course Updater to update course start and end dates, as well as whether a course is active or inactive. You can search your organization's courses and update a group of courses at the same time.
When to use Course Updater
The Course Updater should be used in systems where course start and end date and course status are not already being controlled by another mechanism. For example, if course dates and status are controlled using SIS integration, use of the Course Updater is not recommended. The SIS integration may revert course parameters back to SIS values. This depends on the type and configuration of the SIS Integration; contact your D2L Account Manager or Project Manager for more information.
The Course Updater is not recommended for situations where Instructors are able to update course dates and active status. The Course Updater is meant to update course dates and active status to a common value, usually based on semester or department. The Course Updater overwrites values set by individual system users which could lead to confusion.



--------------------------------------------------


Set up Course Updater

To use the Course Updater tool, administrators must enable the Course Updater tool. Once enabled, administrators must grant the See Course Updater permission to users that need to use the tool.
Once the Course Updater tool is enabled and the See Course Updater permission is granted, Course Updater must be added to the navbar to make it available to users.



--------------------------------------------------


Search for and update courses

Search for courses
On the Course Updater page, in the Search for courses field, enter a value.
To add parameters to your search, click Show Advanced Filters.
Do any of the following:To search for courses by department, in the Department drop-down list, select a department.To search for courses by semester, in the Semester drop-down list, select a semester.To search for courses by status, in the Active drop-down list, select active or inactive.To search by start date, in the Course Start drop-down list, select an option. In the filter fields, enter dates.To search by end date, in the Course End drop-down list, select an option. In the filter fields, enter dates.
Click the Search icon.
Update your courses
From the search results, you can update the start date, end date, or active status of the courses.
Do any of the following:To modify the start date of the courses, select the Update Course Start check box. Select a date and time.To modify the end date of the courses, select the Update Course End check box. Select a date and time.To modify the course status, select the Update Active check box. Select a status.
If you want to offset the course start or course end dates, select Update by Offset radio button and set the Offset By Days fields to the correct start or end date.
Click Update Selected or Update All.




--------------------------------------------------


Troubleshoot Course Updater

Prior to the courses being updated, a check is made to ensure that the update does not have a start date that occurs after the end date. If this scenario occurs, a list of invalid date entries is presented. When this error occurs, none of the course offerings are updated. Change the dates that you are updating and attempt to update again.
Troubleshooting: My course did not update
Possible causes:
The course was added or changed while the Course Updater was running.
The course was created after the search results were found but before the Course Updater was run.
Possible solution: Do not run the update while courses are being created, whether manually, using batch course create, or using SIS integration.
Troubleshooting: I updated the wrong course
Use the following steps if you updated a course accidentally:
To change a single course, click Course Admin > Course Offering Information and change the dates or activity status.
To change a group of courses, run a closely defined search for those specific courses in the Course Updater and run another update.

Set default settings for display indicators

To set default settings for display indicators
Administrators can set org-level default settings for display indicators in the Class Progress dashboard and User Progress report. This allows instructors to see Class and User Progress items relevant to their organization without having to change what displays on the page. If necessary, instructors can override the default settings in their individual courses. 
Note the following:
To modify the default settings, assign the new Class Progress > Modify Org Default Progress Indicators permission to users.
If a user does not have access to one of the default indicators, based on their permissions for that tool, the indicator does not display. For example, 3 indicators might display instead of 4.
Visiting User Progress from the org level and changing settings does not change the org defaults.
If the Course Progress page has been visited at least once in previously existing courses, the settings for those courses are not overridden by this change.
New courses inherit the default settings.
To reset all the defaults to your org defaults, the Reset all Course Settings option resets the defaults for every course. Administrators should carefully consider this option and communicate the change to their instructors to minimize disruption.
From Admin Tools, under Course Related, click Class Progress and User Progress.
From the Class Progress tab, set which indicators display in the table on the Class Progress dashboard by clicking the context menu and selecting Move up, Move down or replace. 
From the User Progress tab, set the following: progress indicators to include, progress report information, and color indicators.
Click Save.

Hide progress indicators from users

Administrators can set the Class and User Progress information visible to their users to determine information visible in all courses. These settings cannot be customized for individual courses. 
As an Administrators, navigate to Class Progress.
In Class Progress, open the content menu for any of the progress indicators, and select Hide from Users.
In User Progress, open the content menu for any of the progress indicators, and select Hide from Users.
To reverse any of these changes, follow the above steps and in the context menu for the progress indicator, select Make Visible to Users.

About the Terms and Conditions tool

The Terms and Conditions tool is turned on by default for your instance.
The Terms and Conditions tool allows administrators to add a terms and conditions page to their instance of Brightspace. Administrators can set the terms and conditions to have no expiry and users are only required to accept the terms if new terms and conditions are added. Administrators can set a date or a relative date at which users are prompted to accept the terms and conditions. Administrators can configure which roles are required to review the terms and conditions using the roles and permissions tool. They can also set the web site behavior for what happens if a user declines the terms and conditions. Administrators can export terms and conditions data to assist in identifying which users have accepted or rejected the terms and conditions.

About organization grade schemes

You create organization grade schemes at the organization level. Once you create them, organization grade schemes are available to all org units.
You can create an organization grade scheme for final grades to ensure that users’ grades are always reported in the same way across your institution.
Organization grade schemes are created and managed from a single area, regardless of which departments or courses use them.
You can create, edit, copy, and delete grade schemes the same way you would complete them if you were creating a course specific scheme.  A grade scheme not associated to a grade item within the course offering is only copied if the grade scheme is unique (i.e. there are no duplicates which match on name and ranges).



--------------------------------------------------


Viewing the Final Grades Audit Log

A background task runs every hour to verify the calculated final grade (CFG) for each course where grade items have recently changed and the CFG is set to be kept up to date. The audit log lists any CFG that was incorrectly calculated (Previous CFG), and the change that has been made to correct it (Corrected CFG).
Viewing the log requires the See the Final Grade Audit Log permission, which is off by default for all roles. The log data contains username values. If your organization does not allow administrators to view usernames due to user information privacy, it is recommended that you do not grant this permission. 
Once you have this permission, you can access the Final Grade Audit Log from the Admin Tools menu.

Ways to initiate Grades Export

Exports may be initiated by a user from Brightspace (push to SIS) or by a process from the SIS (pull from Brightspace). The process you choose depends on your institution’s preferred approach and the capabilities of your SIS.
Enable the Grades Export tool
The Grades Export tool must be enabled in order for users to have access to the Grades Export page. Install administrators and D2LSupport can configure this tool. 
From the Admin Tools menu on the minibar, select Tools.
Toggle GradesExport. 
Process flow: Pulling grades from Brightspace by a SIS 
Instructors review and confirm grades in Brightspace. 
In the SIS user interface, instructors initiate grade import. 
The SIS requests grades for a course from Grades Export, which packages the grades and returns them to the SIS. 
A response by Grades Export reports errors and successes to the SIS. 
The instructor can review feedback in the SIS user interface. 
Process flow: Pushing grades to a SIS
This section lists the typical events that users experience during the Grades Export process. Your process may vary depending on how you configure Grades, Grades Export, and IPSIS. 
Click Grades on the org unit's navbar. 
In the Enter Grades tool, click Export to SIS to access the Grades Export page. Note: Users with Export Grades permission and a properly configured ExportHandlerPage can see this link. 
Select a section from the Scope list. The name of the section, the number of users who will be exported, and the number of users that cannot be exported for the section are displayed. Click View Details to see the users, their grades, and reasons for any exclusions. 
Click Export to initiate an export of grades for the chosen section. Grades marked as ‘Excluded’ are not sent. The export request goes into a ‘Pending’ state and waits for the Grades Export service to process the request. Users can navigate away from the current page and return at a later point in time to review the results of the Grades Export. Users can also initiate exports for other sections for the same or different course offering while exports are in progress or pending. 
Beside the Scope list, click Refresh and then wait for the export to complete. When the export is complete, it appears under the Most Recent Exports list to the right of the page. 
To view the Export Details page for the export, click the name of the section in the Most Recent Exports list. The Export Details page contains information about who initiated and when the export ran, whose grades and how many user grades were successfully sent to the SIS, whose were not, and who was excluded. 
Click Export to SIS at the top of the page to return to the main Grades Export page.

About the Course Branding tool

The Course Branding tool (CBT) allows for bulk branding of Course Offerings in Brightspace. Thus, courses that would otherwise be grouped together (same Faculty, same Year, re-offering of the same course, etc.) can appear and behave in the same manner. 
The Course Branding tool can apply a consistent homepage, navbar,  and course tool active status across many courses at once. Examples include: a particular branding for a product division, each school in a district, or even departments within a school or group of schools.
The choice of how to brand courses is usually done in one of two ways: Explicit branding and Structure-based branding.
Explicit branding
Explicit branding consists of explicitly choosing, on a course-by-course basis, a source course to copy branding from and a destination course to apply branding to. The branding tool supports a simple two-column “source,destination” input file located in a configured location in Brightspace.
Using Explicit branding
D2L recommends that you use Branding Mode as your configuration mode when using Explicit Branding. Be sure that CsvSimple is set in the branding mode configuration.  The reasons why you would do this are described above.
Place a CSV file in the csv-in path and CBT reads the directory and applies the branding from the source courses to the destination course.  Note that when you use this mode (and there are subsequent branding modes in the branding mode configuration) they are skipped.
The format of the CSV file to be placed in the csv-in path is Source_orgunit_code or id,destination_orgunit_code or id
Therefore, CSVs should look like the following:
12223,12554
12223,12667
12456,12998
Structure-based branding
Structure-based branding brands courses based on where they are in the organizational structure instead of taking user-defined input. For example, courses in each faculty or college can be branded based on a standard for that faculty or college. Any level can be used to define a branding area (faculty, colleges, departments, and even semesters or course templates) and all courses are branded consistently within that region of the organization.
Appearance elements (like navbar and logos) are set based on configuration settings, while functional choices (like tool selection and homepage) are left for individual courses to set.
Branding can come either from the branding-level item itself (e.g., the Department org unit itself can have its branding copied to its descendants) or a special navshell course within each branding area. In this manner, areas of the organization can opt-in and opt-out of the branding process by choosing whether to have a navshell or not. Areas without navshells use the default course branding theme set for the organization.
Using Structure-based branding
If you choose to set Structure Level is Source to true, as soon as the scheduled task is set, all child courses under the set parent (Default Structure Level -> department for example) inherit the branding from the parent.  You can choose to exclude specific Course Offerings by adding them to the ignore list via the add-ignore process.
If you plan to use structure-based branding (suggested), the following settings are required:
Make sure you set the Default Structure Level (Department is default).
If you want ‘departments’ to choose when they opt-in to their own branding: set ‘Structure Level is Source’ to false; andEnsure the Course Offerings used as your branding sources have the navshell string in their Course Offering Code.
If you want to enforce course branding under each ‘department’ to mimic what the department org unit, then:Set ‘Structure Level is Source’ to true;By setting this, all courses under each department inherit the branding from the department org unit itself
If there are courses under each department that should be skipped in terms of branding, ensure you add a CSV file with those courses to the add-ignore folder.  To remove items from the ignore list, make sure you add a CSV file with its org unit code to the remove-ignore folder.If you plan to use explicit branding, make sure you put your CSV files in the CSV In Path.
To use structure-based branding, D2L recommends the following configuration:
Structure Level is Source (true/false) – if true, the second option below is used.  If false, the navshell mode will be used.
Branding Mode – make sure that remove-ignore|add-ignore|full is set in the branding mode configuration.  The reasons why you would do this are described above.
Navshell pattern – configure the pattern in this setting if you want "departments" to opt-in.
Option 1 - If you are using the navshell model
Create a course under the department and make sure that the course code includes navshell <what you configured in the navshell pattern configuration> in its name.
Go to the course.
Set the branding in the course. The steps to do so are described below, but D2L recommends that you do this (i.e., create theme, navbars, homepages) at the org level. In the branding course you select the navshell, homepage specific to this parent org unit.Create a new theme (if needed).Create a new navbar (make sure it is shared with the organization) and set it as active in the course.Create a new homepage (make sure it is shared with the organization) and set it as active in the course.Set the new branding in the course.
Set the tool status.Go to Course Admin.Select Tools.Turn tools on/off based on what you want your end users (i.e. instructors and learners) to see.
Next time CBT runs, it finds the navshell and applies branding to all courses under the parent.
Option 2 - If you are using the Structure Level Is Source model
Go to the Org Unit Editor.
Find the org unit item that is the Structure (e.g. department).
Click the Homepage link in the Jump to section.
Setup the branding that will be set across all courses under this parent.Set the branding in the course.Create a new theme.Create a new navshell and make sure it is shared with the organization.Create a new homepage and make sure it is shared with the organization.Set the tool status.
Next time CBT runs, it selects the branding for each parent and applies that branding to all courses under that parent.  With this path, a parent (department for example) cannot opt-out of this configuration, so all courses under each department have the same branding as the department org unit itself.
If you want to exclude certain courses for either use case above, you need to include a CSV file in the add-ignore folder.  The CSV file should have the orgunit_code or id in each line.  If in the future you want that course to follow the same branding as its siblings, create a CSV file with the orgunit_code or id in each line then add it into the remove-ignore folder.



--------------------------------------------------


Using the Course Branding tool

Branding terminology
Branding level : An org unit type within the organization; for example, Department. All courses descended from a branding-level are branded in the same way. A branding-level and its children are called a branding area.
Branding source: An org unit (typically a course offering, but not necessarily) whose active homepage, active navbar, colours, and tool statuses are copied out to other org units.
Branding destination: The org units (course offering) that are branded from a source.
Branding runs can have multiple sources and multiple destinations. A CSV file can define a source and destination for each line in the file. A full sweep may have one source for each branding area in the organization and apply its branding to thousands of destination courses.
Execution modes
Course Branding tool currently has four supported modes: 
CsvSimple mode
Full mode
add-ignore mode
remove-ignore mode
You can only specify a single mode to run at a time. The Course Branding processes add-ignore and remove-ignore every run, and as such they do not need to specify these modes.
CsvSimple mode
This mode of execution reads csv files from the directory declared in the “path/csv-in” config setting.
Every CSV file consists of two columns: the org unit id or org unit code of the source course, and the org unit id of the destination course.  For each row in the CSV file, the Course Branding tool takes the active branding of the source course and applies it to the destination.
Full mode
This mode of execution causes the Course Branding tool to attempt to brand all courses in the organization inside the designated branding-level (if no branding level is provided, the default value, Department, is used instead).  Course offerings not inside an org unit of the branding-level type are not branded (e.g., courses not in departments are not branded).
The tool first builds a list of all branding-level org units in the organization.  It then builds a list of all Course Offering children for each of these org units and identifies the source branding org unit (either the branding org unit itself, or the navshell Course Offering).  Finally, it applies branding from the source to all other courses.
A course will not be branded if:
It is not within a branding area (e.g., not in a department);
Its branding area does not have a navshell Course Offering; and/or
Its Course Offering Code matches the navshell pattern, even if the course has not been chosen as the branding source.
Add-ignore mode
This mode of execution reads all CSV files in the add-ignore-in folder (defined in the config file).  Each row contains an org unit id or org unit code that will be added to the ignore list.  Courses in the ignore list are not branded unless force branding is set to true.
When complete, this execution mode moves the CSV files  to the add-ignore-out folder.
Remove-ignore mode
This mode of execution reads all CSV files in the remove-ignore-in folder (defined in the configuration).  Each row contains an org unit id or org unit code that will be removed from the ignore list.  Courses in the ignore list are not branded unless force branding is set to true.
When complete, this execution mode moves the CSV files  to the remove-ignore-out folder.
Adjusting Schedules
By default, the task runs once a day, typically overnight or early morning. To adjust the start time or add additional runs, submit a Request to Add or Modify Scheduled Task through the Service Request Catalog, detailing the desired scheduled task adjustments for custom Course Branding.

Full Branding Options


Configuration Name 


Configuration Description


Default Value


Default Structure Level

The parent level that a full branding operation should look under for courses to branding.
Department
Navshell Pattern
The orgunit code pattern to use as a source orgunit for a full branding operation
navshell
Structure Level Is Source
Use the parent level as the source orgunit for full branding operations
false
Default Structure Level
When run in full mode, branding is applied to all children of the specified Org Unit Type, using the Org Unit Type Name as the value. If no branding level is defined, the default of Department is used.
Navshell Pattern
Navshell Pattern is only used when Structure Level Is Source is false.
The pattern specified is a string match against Course Offering Code to identify the source course. If more than one Course Offering Code is found to match the string pattern, the tool uses the first-created course (i.e., the course with the lowest Org Unit number).
The active components from the matching source course in each branding structure level are copied into their child Course Offerings, as per the enabled generic options.
If no matching Course Offering Code is found in the branding structure level, no offerings are branded nor are they added to the ignore list in full mode.  They can be branded later.  This allows branding areas to “opt-in” to the branding process by choosing not to have a navshell Course Offering until they are ready.
Structure Level Is Source
This determines whether the specified branding structure level Org Unit itself is the branding source.
When set to true, the active components of each identified structure level are copied into their child Course Offerings, as per the enabled generic options.
If set to false, the specified navshell pattern is used to identify the branding source.



--------------------------------------------------


Using Course Branding tool in full mode

Full mode shares (or copies) branding from a model branding course.
Configure Course Branding settings
Ensure the Custom Course Branding tool is turned on in Organization Tools.
From the Admin Tools menu, select Customization Config.
Set the Search Filter to  Course Branding Runner.
Leave the Search field blank and select Search. Note: If the Health Check Status shows a problem, select the link, and check the error. The CBT may still run even though an error is showing. You can report the error  to D2L Support for assistance.
Set the items that you want to be copied/set during each run of the CBT. Available options include: Brand Colors, Brand Homepages, Brand Toolbars (Navbars) and Brand Tools. Set the Default option to True.
Set the Branding Mode to  Full (default). 
Set the Copy If Necessary setting to  False. Note: The True setting  creates copies of the homepages and navbars if they are out of scope and cannot be shared with the destination org unit. This can lead to a large number of copied navbars and homepages.
Set the Default Structure Level to the org level type that defines the top org unit of the branch to be branded using the model branding course setup. Examples include: Division, School, Department, etc.
Set the Force Branding setting:
Select True if you want all changes are to be overwritten on each run of the CBT
Select False if all users are permitted to make changes to the Navbars and Homepages. If this is not set, all changes will be lost on each run of the CBT.
Set the NavShell Pattern to match a keyword or character sequence that will appear in the model branding course offering.
Set up the Themes, Navbars and Homepages to be shared
Create the Themes, Navbars and Homepages on the first (or top) org unit of the branch to be shared to all lower level org units and course offerings.
From the Admin Tools menu, select Org Unit Editor.
Navigate to the top level of the org structure of the branch in which the bulk branding will be applied.
Select the Jump To: Homepage link.
From the Navbar/Homepage Actions menu, select Manage Navbars/Homepages.
Create a copy of the Theme/Navbar/Homepage that you want to edit. 
Edit the Theme/Navbar/Homepage with the branding style you want. Make it available to: All descendants of this top level (or All descendants of type: Course Offering).
Set up the Model Course Offering
Create a course shell within a course template. Ensure that the NavShell Pattern is included within the Org Unit Code. Figure: A sample course shell within a course template. 
From the Course Administration menu, edit the course offering as follows:
Ensure the Navbar appears as desired (including the theme) for all of the course offerings within this branch of the org structure. The structure and links will be copied, as well as the theme and color scheme.
Ensure the Homepage has the desired homepage structure for all of the course offerings within this branch of the org structure. The layout and widgets will be copied. The banner is not copied and can be set by the user if they have the necessary permissions.
Ensure the course tools are the set of desired tools for all of the course offerings within this branch of the org structure.
As a best practice, D2L recommends the following: 
Create the Model Branding course offering within a course template that clearly indicates the location of the Model Branding course offering. 
Create a Semester called "Branding" and assign all Model Branding course offerings to this semester. This makes it easy to find all Model Branding courses from the top org level.
Note: Work with your D2L Support, your LAM/TAM, CSM or your Implementation Team Lead to request the CBT scheduled task be set to run daily after new courses are created.

/content/BulkTools/CBT/remove-ignore-out
CBT requires several folders to be created in your environment.  If these folders do not exist, errors appear in your System Logs (and an Error status in the Customization Config Health check Status).
Environments should be configured with a default set of the required folders created and the corresponding paths populated in the Customization Config tool; however this should be validated and adjusted as needed should there be a desire to use a different path structure. Create any new path structure through Organization Files prior to adjusting the configuration.
The Custom Branding paths exist beneath /content/BulkTools/CBT/ with the following subdirectories :
add-ignore-in
add-ignore-out
csv-in
csv-out
remove-ignore-in
remove-ignore-out
If adjusting the Custom Branding paths to use other than the defaults, once required folders are created, go to the Customization Config tool and update each corresponding config with the path created.
Open Search Filter, select Course Branding Runner, and click the Search button.
Setup the file paths as described earlier in this document (base installation path\CBT\<folder you created earlier>)
Once you set all the configurations, wait until the next scheduled time to validate.



--------------------------------------------------


Course Branding Troubleshooting

By default, only Errors and Fatal log show up in the log.  If you need to troubleshoot Custom Branding, you need to increase the log level. This can be done by using the following instructions:
From the Admin Tools menu, click Logging Configuration.
In the search dialog, search for branding.  One of the following should return:D2L.Custom.CourseBrandingRunner; orD2L.Custom.CourseBranding.
In the CourseBranding assembly that is returned, click the name to configure the debugging level.
Click Custom Configuration and set the log level. This is usually debug for troubleshooting purposes. (D2L recommens you set an expiry time so that the extra log information does not clutter your system log.)
Once this is configured, logs show up in the System Log.

About Brightspace Creator+

Brightspace Creator+ is a content authoring package that provides opportunities for users to create  highly desirable, engaging, and delightful experiences in minutes. With easy-to-use tools and leveraging existing workflows, creators can build dynamic content and media experiences that appeal to the love of learning, improve comprehension, and achieve high engagement for instructors and learners. 
Creator+ offers the following 4 main tools for content creators to enhance their course content:
 Insert Element enables users to easily and seamlessly create dynamic content and chunk concepts following instructional design best practices.
Practices to deepen comprehension and reinforce concepts using formative practice questions in Content HTML topics.
Advanced Media using Capture App to quickly capture screen and video learning assets that can be automatically captioned, edited, and used across your courses. 
Creator+ content templates that you can easily edit with Creator+ tools to get started quickly. Admins can use the Content Styler to centrally style content using a default cascading style sheet.
The Brightspace Creator+ package is an evolution of the former Engagement+ package and is available as an add-on to Brightspace. If you previously purchased the Engagement+ package, you are automatically licensed for the Creator+ package.



--------------------------------------------------


Creator+ Quick Start

The following instructions provide you with the steps required to enable Creator+ in your Brightspace environment. 
Enabling Organization Tools
Creator+ consists of five tools that must be turned on in Admin Tools. These tools include Content Styler, Insert Element, Practices, Layouts, and Capture.
From your Brightspace homepage, select Admin Tools.
Select Organization Tools.
Search for each tool and select the Availability toggle to enable the following Creator+ tools:
Content Styler (Toolid 806000)
Insert Element (Toolid 804000)
Practices (Toolid 805000)
Layouts (Toolid 901000)
Capture (Toolid 581000)
Note: These tools may already be enabled depending on your tool history.
Setting Configuration Variables
You can enable Creator+ for your whole organization or roll out Creator+ tools for a smaller pilot by using the D2l.Tools.CreatorPlus.IsEnabled configuration variable. None of the Creator+ tools are visible until you turn on the configuration variable. D2l.Tools.CreatorPlus.IsEnabled is a cascading configuration variable that allows you to enable Creator+ tools for your whole organization, a semester, or a department.
When the D2L.Tools.CreatorPlus.IsEnabled configuration variable is ON, Practices and Insert Element immediately appear in the Classic Content and New Content (Lessons) edit page. The Content Styler applies the Creator+ style sheets to newly-created topics. A new or updated style sheet is not retroactively applied to existing topics.
Setting up Content Styler
Content Styler enables you to define the cascading style sheet you want to use in all new HTML topics. 
Ensure that your role has the Can Manage Content Style CSS permission.
From the Organization home page, click Admin Tools.Under Security, click Roles and Permissions.Click the Role, such as Administrator, that you want to be able to use the Content Styler.From the Filter by Tool drop-down menu, select Content Styler.Click the check box for Organization to apply the Can Manage Content Style CSS permission to use the Content Styler for all org units in your organization.
After you apply the permission, all users with that role can see the Content Styler in the Organization Tools list. Important: D2L recommends that you only grant this permission to a small set of administrators as changes affect all HTML topics that have the style sheet applied. 
Verify that the Content Styler appears in Admin Tools under Organization Related. If it does not, use the workflow outlined in the Enabling Organization Tools section of this page to enable the Content Styler tool.
Ensure that the two required configuration variables related to Content Styler are correctly set.
From the Organization home page, click Admin ToolsUnder Organization Related, click Config Variable Browser.Browse to or search for d2l.Tools.ContentStyler.AddStylesOnContentCreate. This configuration variable allows you to turn on or turn off Content Styler at various levels in your courses, meaning that you can apply Content Styler in specific departments, templates, or courses. Ensure the variable is set to ON for the org unit parent where you want any style sheets to be applied when creating new topics.Note: This may already be ON by default for your organization. This is a cascading variable, meaning that configuration variables cascade to all descendant org unit types. For example, if you select a specific semester, all courses in that semester will have the updated styles.Browse to or search for d2l.Tools.ContentStyler.CssOverride. This configuration variable specifies the style sheets that you want to apply when a new topic is created. If you do not specify a CSS here, the default Brightspace Creator+ styles are used. Define which courses should have the default Creator+ CSS or an override CSS applied.For information about adjusting CSS styles, refer to Set up consistent style and branding in your organization with Creator+ Content Styler.
Setting up Insert Element
Insert Element does not require additional permissions or configuration variables. Insert Element will appear in the Brightspace Editor in Classic Content and New Content (Lessons) New Edit Experience within the Other Insert Options menu.
Insert Elements will work with any template and do not require that you specify the language of the page.
Setting up Practices
Practices do not require additional permissions or configuration variables. Practices will appear in the Brightspace Editor in Classic Content and New Content (Lessons) New Edit Experience within the Other Insert Options menu.
Practices are compatible with any template. The language set on the page dictates the language of the user interface. If there is no language specified, Practices reverts to English.
Hot Tip: When you copy a course that contains Practices, ensure you copy the associated files in the course. If the Practice was copied without associated files, search for the Practices folder in the original course root directory. You can zip the folder and move it to the new course location.
Setting up Capture
Capture can be downloaded and/or launched from the Media Library. Media Library is available in the Admin Tools menu, or as a link on the navigation bar. When in the Media Library, Capture App is available using Add > Create Presentation.
To use the Capture tool, ensure that these permissions are granted to the appropriate users:
Capture > Can Access Capture App
Content Service > Can Access Media Library Management Tool (recommended for Admin and Instructor roles)
Content Service > Can manage objects
Content Service > Can manage all objects (recommended for Admin roles only)
For more information about the permissions associated with Capture, refer to Media Library Permissions. 
For more information about using Capture, see Create a presentation with Capture Web or Create a presentation with the Capture App
Additional Resources
The Creator+ Instructional Design Best Practices course includes short videos for each Creator+ tool, best practices for using the tools, access to Creator+ templates, and a Frequently Asked Questions resource.
Note: You must be a registered member of Brightspace Community to access the Learning Center.



--------------------------------------------------


Capture App for Creator+ system requirements

Set up style and branding with Creator+ Content Styler

Setting up Content Styler
The Content Styler is an administrator tool that is part of the Creator+ add on package. It works with Brightspace Editor to support theming and styling of content pages within Brightspace. It applies a global style to content pages and supports the Insert Element tool that requires a consistent branding, theming, and styling within content pages.
Note: For information about setting up the permission to adjust your CSS, see  Creator+ Quick Start
There are two options:

Use the cloud-hosted default Creator+ cascading style sheet (CSS) that is maintained by D2L. The CSS can be moderately configured by using the Content Styler editor tool to modify four key parts of the default CSS, including headers, font and color, accent color, and accessible color. The Content Styler option is available in the Organization Related section or Admin Tools.  


Link to a client-hosted CSS and cascade to different areas of your organization as needed.

In both cases, you must update the d2l.Tools.ContentStyler.CssOverride configuration variable points to the preferred CSS. 
Adjusting the default Creator+ styles with Content Styler
To edit the default Creator+ cascading style sheet (hosted by D2L)

From your Organization home page, click Admin Tools .


Under Organization Related, click Content Styler.


In the Content Styler dialog, enter a name and description to your CSS modification.
Note: Currently, the name and description will be important in future releases when you can curate multiple style sheets for your organization. Presently, there is only one central Creator+ style sheet that can be created and managed using the Content Styler tool. 

Figure: The Content Styler  dialog, providing the ability to edit Accent, Accessible Accent, Header colors, and Header Font styles.


Click the drop down icons to edit text colors: 

Accent color applies to Insert Elements, such as the decorative border or the underline attribute of Heading. The Accent color is not used for any text-based elements.


Accessible Accent is the background color with white text to add emphasis to some Insert Elements, such as the Jumbo Call Out. 


Header is the color used for all levels of headers. The header color must be accessible on a white background. 


Header Font sets the font style for your headers.


Figure: The color picker provides the ability to select a color either manually or by entering a hex code value, set  saturation, and check accessibility contrast.


When you have completed the updates to your style sheet, click Save. 


If this is the first time you have used the Content Styler, copy the location and paste it in the d2l.Tools.ContentStyler.CssOverride configuration variable at the appropriate org level. It automatically cascades to all child org units. 

Figure: The first time you use the Content Styler, it displays the location where the CSS is saved.

Figure: The d2l.Tools.ContentStyler.CssOverride configuration variable, showing the pasted CSS location and an override example.

Adding override cascading style sheets
If you want to add an override style sheet to a specific set of org units, the following values are supported:

Content Styler override value provided as the Location in Content Styler


Path to a CSS file hosted in Shared files in the format \shared\folderpaths\cssfile.css


Full URL to an external client hosted CSS file

Note: The Content Styler changes are not retroactively applied to existing HTML topics; they only apply to new HTML content topics. Administrators can define which courses should have the styles applied to new HTML content. Deleting the referenced style sheet from the configuration variable does not impact existing topics, unless you also delete the style sheet referenced is also deleted from the system.

Brightspace Virtual Assistant was built to provide users with the best support experience when using Brightspace. With the addition of the AI tool in the LMS:
Users have direct access to help articles from Brightspace Community without having to leave Brightspace. 
Administrators can find relevant resources to complete org setup and complete tasks with how-to instructions available directly in the right-hand corner of Brightspace.
Instructors can find step-by-step guides and video tutorials on how to set up their course and its respective activities directly within the product rather than in a new browser tab or window.
	Students can find help documentation related to their course issues without having to leave the space where the problem exists, resulting in an overall increase in Brightspace adoption.
If users still need more assistance, they can contact a live support agent directly from Brightspace without seeking D2L End User Support contact information elsewhere.
Language Support in Brightspace Virtual Assistant
Brightspace Virtual Assistant is available in the following four EUS-supported languages:
English 
French (CA)
Spanish (LATAM)
Portuguese (BR)
The Language and Locale setting in a user's profile determines the language of the Brightspace Virtual Assistant’s output messages, the language of the surfaced support articles, and the language of the support received for any chosen channel (phone, email, chat).
Note: If a user’s chosen Language and Locale is not one of the four languages available in End User Support, the default language offered in Brightspace Virtual Assistant is English.
Visibility of the Brightspace Virtual Assistant
The Brightspace Virtual Assistant is available throughout the LMS except for the following pages: 
LTI/ Third Party Tool Integrations
Assignments: Evaluate Assignments
Discussions: Evaluate Topic 
Discussions: Evaluate Learner
Full Screen Pages in Content and Media Player
It is also possible to hide Brightspace Virtual Assistant during live quiz attempts. However, it may be beneficial in some cases if a learner experiences a glitch and cannot proceed with their activity. There is no internet search available in Virtual Assistant to provide answers to any question beyond tasks in Brightspace. 
Note: The decision to hide Brightspace Virtual Assistant during quiz attempts must be made during the deployment process.

Configuring Brightspace Virtual Assistant

Brightspace Virtual Assistant is available to subscribers of D2L End User Support only. To enable Brightspace Virtual Assistant for your organization, contact your EUS Manager. 
If you do not currently subscribe to EUS and are interested in the Brightspace Virtual Assistant, contact your D2L Account Team for more information on the EUS packages.
Customizing the Brightspace Virtual Assistant
EUS clients can include a custom greeting and a small number of custom buttons for end-user inquiries specific to the organization. Custom buttons can be used to provide users with information about frequently asked questions that are unrelated to D2L Support. These buttons appear immediately once the Brightspace Virtual Assistant is activated to provide users with this information right away.
 For example:

Custom Button #1: How do I enroll/unenroll in courses? 


Button Answer #1: For enrollment inquiries, please contact the Registrar’s Office at 123-456-7890.

Other examples include topics such as Financial Aid, Enrollment Inquiries, and Advisor Services.
Note: D2L recommends adding a maximum of 4-5 custom buttons to the AI for an optimal user experience. D2L EUS clients should work with their EUS Manager to set up and determine which buttons should be created.
In addition to custom buttons, your organization can customize the greeting that appears as soon as a user clicks on the Brightspace Virtual Assistant. For example;

Hello John, I’m the [organization name] Brightspace Virtual Assistant.

Manage the visibility of Brightspace Virtual Assistant for users
Administrators can manage the visibility of Virtual Assistant for the roles in your organization using Roles and Permissions. 
To enable/ disable Brightspace Virtual Assistant for user roles in your organization:

From the Admin Tools menu, click Roles and Permissions.


From the context menu of the role for which you want to edit properties, click Edit Permissions. 


In the Filter by Tool drop-down list, select Users. Click Apply Filter.


 Select the check box for the See End User Support Widget permission.


Click Save and Close.





--------------------------------------------------


Accessing help with Brightspace Virtual Assistant

Brightspace Virtual Assistant appears on the login page for your organization, but you must log in to Brightspace before you can access its full functionality. It is recommended to display contact information for available support resources if users experience Brightspace authentication issues.
Note: For organizations where users access the LMS through another SSO system, pre-login information is still recommended in case a user lands on the Brightspace authentication page.

Click Read Article to read the resource(s) in full screen within the widget.
Click the ← arrow button to return to the search results
Click the Open in new tab button to view the resource in Community.

About Data Hub

Data Hub is  part of the Brightspace Core package and provides access to your organization's data for data mining, research, and analysis.
Data is the fundamental building block in the process to answer questions and enable conversations around usage, engagement, adoption, assessment, and more. Data Hub allows administrators to access collections of data (data sets) from Brightspace and  export them as CSV files for further analysis in third party tools. This gives administrators the flexibility to filter, aggregate, and transform the data according to their needs.
Data Hub is available to all Brightspace Core customers.
Navigate Data Hub
Click Data Hub on your navbar to open the Data Hub landing page.
Figure: The Data Hub landing page with the Data Sets tab selected.
The Data Sets tab has a table containing all available data sets, which you can sort by Name, Category, or Description. You can use the Search field to search for a specific data set.
The Job Status tab lists the submission date and status of  Advanced Data Sets. The link to download an ADS export is available on this tab for 30 days after it was generated.
Data set types
The  following data set types are available in Data Hub:
Brightspace Data Sets are tables of raw, user-level data from Brightspace. They are designed to be joined together to build your own reports. Users do not set filters for these reports as all data is included.  Brightspace Data Sets execute on a scheduled task.
Advanced Data Sets are reports that combine data from multiple Brightspace Data Sets. Administrators can generate them as needed by defining one or more filters such as dates and org units. The data behind these data sets is updated daily.
Full data sets and differential data sets
To analyze and report on the data, Brightspace Data Sets are available in both full data sets and differentials. Full data sets  contain a complete view of historical data and they are larger and take longer to download. Differential data sets only contain the data that has been changed since the last successful run, making them smaller, more up-to-date, and faster to download.
Note the following about differential data sets:
To prevent data gaps, updated data sets include some overlap. For example, an updated data set may contain rows from the last few minutes of the previous hour and the next few minutes of the next hour.
Only inserts or updates display, including updates to existing Is_Deleted columns.
Only updates on first-class data display. For example, the Quiz Attempts data set displays additional attempts; however, updates to the QuizName field do not display.
BDS Schedules
Brightspace Data Sets run on a schedule designed by D2L to optimize performance across all our clients. Please be aware that the scheduled time is for the initiation of the data set generation. We do not provide guarantees of how long the data set generation will take to complete.
With the default schedule, full data sets refresh once a week and differential data sets refresh once a day.
There are 2 paid add-on packages for more frequent data generation. To purchase an add-on for Data Hub, contact your D2L Account Manager.
Hourly Differentials add-on
With this package, differential data sets refresh every hour instead of once a day. Full data sets refresh once a day instead of once a week.
This can be helpful for administrators with high-frequency reporting needs, who have automated processes, reports, or dashboards set up. 
Daily Fulls and Daily Diffs add-on
With this package, full data sets refresh once a day instead of once a week. Differential data sets continue to refresh once a day.
This can be helpful for administrators who are learning to use differentials and need space to expand their data operations.
Data Limits
Most Brightspace Data Sets adhere to the default system limit to return 150 million rows of the most recent data.
The following Brightspace Data Sets are limited by date, not by number of rows:
3 years of data (the previous two calendar years and the current calendar year to date):Content User CompletionContent User ProgressQuiz User Answer ResponsesQuiz User AnswersSession History

To track changes  in Brightspace Platform releases, BDS have their own version number. When the BDS version number updates, as a part of your monthly  Continuous Delivery (CD) software update, changes appear in the data the next time the BDS are generated.
If the BDS are in the process of being generated when the version number changes, any data set generated after that change reflects the latest version. As a result, you might have some data that reflects the previous version and some data that reflects the latest version, for a short time.
BDS version numbers consist of a major version (the number before the decimal point) and a minor version (the number after the decimal point). Specific changes to individual BDS are captured in their respective reference tables. Each reference table displays the BDS version number for each change under Version History.

Major Versions
When a new major version (such as 5.X) is released, clients normally have a 4-month opt-in window where they can choose to adopt the new major version; when this window is over, clients are automatically updated. However, when the new version is required to resolve a defect, client versions are immediately and automatically updated. For more information about managing BDS updates, refer to Brightspace Data Sets Change Management Policy on Brightspace Community.
Since the July 2023/20.23.7 release, the default BDS major version  is 8. For more information about major version 8, refer to Motivations behind the changes in Data Hub Brightspace Data Set (BDS) Major Version 8 on Brightspace Community.
In the April 2024/20.24.4 release, the default BDS major version will change to 9. For more information about major version 9, refer to Motivations behind the changes in Data Hub Brightspace Data Set (BDS) Major Version 9 on Brightspace Community.
Minor Versions
Minor version updates (such as 4.7 to 4.8) contain low impact changes that will not break downstream systems or reporting, such as adding a column. Since the September 2017/10.7.5 release, the Continuous Delivery (CD) software update automatically rolls out a new BDS minor version to clients every month. In some releases, there are no changes to the data sets, but the minor version number goes up anyway. This makes it easier for us to plan updates because we know far in advance what the exact BDS version number will be.
Sometimes we refer to a minor version with no documented changes (such as v8.8) in the BDS reference tables under Version History. This simply means we published a correction or clarification to the BDS documentation during the release that corresponds with that minor version number.
Entity Relationship Diagrams
Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are graphical representations of the relationships of entities stored in a database. ERDs help administrators understand how databases work, which is useful when attempting to join Brightspace Data Sets together to create a custom data output. 
Each Brightspace Data Set category (Announcements, Assignments, Attendance, etc.) includes an ERD that shows the types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.) between all entities, including which fields are Primary Keys (PKs) and Foreign Keys (FKs), and which fields can be null.

Set up Data Hub

Data Hub is available to all Brightspace Core customers, but before you can use it you must ensure that you meet the expected platform requirements and have the correct configuration variables and permissions enabled. The data sets that you see in the Data Hub depend on your Brightspace configuration.
Data Hub platform requirements
Data Hub is compatible with  Brightspace 10.7+.
The framework used to generate all CSV exports is the Data Export Framework, embedded in the Brightspace platform. All existing workflows to access and generate CSV exports from custom reports have been preserved.
Brightspace Data Sets are CSV extracts of data from Brightspace, available in the following regions:
North America
EMEA
APAC 
Turn on the Data Hub tool
From the Admin Tools menu, select Organization Tools.
On the Tool Availability page, enable Advanced Data Sets, Brightspace Data Sets, and Custom Reporting Framework.
Data Hub configuration variables
The  following  configuration variables are related to Data Hub:
d2l.Tools.AdvancedDataSets.ProgramOrgUnitTypeId (Org) - To use the Course Learning Outcome Evaluation (CLOE) ADS or Program Level Outcomes Evaluation (PLOE) ADS, you must set this configuration variable to the org unit type ID that represents a program for an org.
d2l.Tools.BrightspaceDataSets.QueueItemTTLHrs (Org) - This value specifies the Brightspace Data Set time to live inside the data sets queue.
d2l.Tools.BrightspaceDataSets.Version (Org) - This value specifies the Brightspace Data Sets contract version. When a new BDS version is released, you can change this configuration variable to test the new version. For more information about BDS versions, refer to About Brightspace Data Sets.
d2l.Tools.DataHub.DataExport.FilenamePattern - Specifies the pattern to use for generated ADS filenames. (Supported replacement strings: {orgId}, {orgUnitId}, {userId}, {userName}, {submitDate}, {reportId}, {reportName}, {defaultFileName}). Org administrators can view or edit this configuration variable. The default value is {reportName}-{submitDate}. This configuration variable and its values are migrated from the existing Custom Reporting Framework configuration.
Data Hub permissions
The  following permissions are required:
Custom Reporting Framework > Can see data hub (Organization level) controls the visibility of the Data Hub tool.Note: You can set this permission at any level within the org, but the Data Hub tool can only be used at the org level and reports generated from within the Data Hub tool contain all org data. 
 Brightspace Data Sets > Can Access Brightspace Data Sets (Organization level) controls the ability to see and download data.
Each Advanced Data Set has its own required permission that must be enabled before running the ADS. These permissions are documented in About Advanced Data Sets.

Export data in Data Hub

Important: Due to the current method for calculating full and differential data sets, all data sets may contain duplicate rows that share identical values. D2L recommends that the tool or automated process that reads your data sets is designed to manage or strip duplicate rows.
How to export a Brightspace Data Set
From the navbar, click Data Hub.
In the Data Sets tab, click the name of a Brightspace Data Set to export.
Choose a full or differential data set (if available) and click Download.
Unzip the ZIP file.
Open the CSV file in a CSV-compatible tool such as Microsoft Excel.
Note: Only complete data sets are available for export. If a data set fails to generate, it does not overwrite the last successfully completed data set. For example, if Tuesday's daily (full) data set fails, Monday's data set remains available. Similarly, if the 2 PM hourly (differential) data set fails, the 3 PM data set includes data targeted for 2 and 3 PM.
How to export an Advanced Data Set
From the navbar, click Data Hub.
In the Data Sets tab, click the name of an Advanced Data Set to export.
Adjust the filters to capture  the data that you want and click Export.
In the Job Status tab, locate the report that you just generated and click Complete.
Unzip the ZIP file.
Open the CSV file in a CSV-compatible tool such as Microsoft Excel.
Important: For Advanced Data Sets with an OrgUnit filter, all descendants of the Org Unit ID you select are included in the report. Avoid selecting an Org Unit ID at the top of your organization, as this can cause very long running reports or even time out errors.
Note: The link to download an ADS export is available on the Job Status tab for 30 days after it was generated.

FAQ
Q: Does this data set provide the size of all files within Brightspace?A: No. This data set only provides data on files associated with content objects. Additionally, it only surfaces data for newly uploaded, edited, or deleted files (associated with content) starting with the release of the data set in July 2022. It does not provide any historical data.
Q: Are Active and Inactive courses included in the data?A: Yes. As long as the files are associated with a content object, it doesn't matter whether the course is active or inactive.
Q: Are all file formats included in the data?A: Yes, all file formats are included when associated with a content object. However, please be aware that this data set does NOT include files that are embedded within an HTML content object.
Q: If courses are copied (via Course Copy or CCS) or imported, will files associated with the newly created course be included in the data?A: Yes, files that are associated with content objects within a copied or imported course are surfaced in the data set with "Created" in the Action field.

Sample join
Here is an example of how these data sets work together.
When a user must complete a discussion post within a forum, and the user must complete a quiz to trigger a release condition for the discussion post to appear, then the discussion post is the result of the release condition, and the quiz is the pre-requisite.
There is a single row in the Release Condition Objects BDS for the discussion-quiz mapping.
There is a row for each user who has completed the required quiz in the PreRequisite Conditions Met BDS.

In some cases, a release condition is set as a negative condition, meaning that it depends on a user not doing something. In that case, Not Met would mean that they have completed the action because the condition no longer applies. In the Release Condition Results BDS, there is a row for every user who has met positive conditions, as well as a row for every user who has not met negative conditions.

These data sets do not have any soft deletes exposed through an IsDeleted column because of the way deletions occur within release conditions.
When you have a release condition about an activity, such as attempting a quiz, and you delete the activity (the quiz), the condition is hard deleted and is removed from the FULL data sets.
When you have a release condition on an activity, and you remove the conditions from that activity, the release conditions will remain in the data sets with OrgUnitId = 0 to indicate they have been removed.
In the Release Condition Objects BDS, there are fields called Id1 and Id2.  Depending on the type of release condition, one or both will be populated with the Id needed to map to the object.  The below table provides some guidance on what Id is displayed.

Outcomes data sets

Brightspace Data Sets for Outcomes have a dependency on the Learning Outcomes tool. If you turn this tool on and off during the data set query period, there may be unexpected or missing content in your data sets.
Entity Relationship Diagram
The following diagram shows the relationships between entities used to create Brightspace Data Sets for Outcomes. To enlarge the diagram, right-click on the image and select Open image in a new tab.

 
Tool-Specific Object Lookup
To retrieve details about tool-specific objects that are aligned to or assessed against learning outcomes, you must reference other Brightspace Data Sets. The values you need to look up a tool-specific object are:

AlignedObjectType: hard-coded number representing the tool-specific object that the outcome is linked to.


AlignedObjectId: unique identifier for the row in the tool-specific object's data set.

Locate your AlignedObjectType in the following table, navigate to the corresponding Reference Column, and locate the row where the unique identifier value matches your AlignedObjectId.
 
AlignedObjectType
Reference Column
1

Data Set: Discussion Topics
Column: TopicId
Type: bigint

2

Data Set: Assignment Summary
Column: DropboxId
Type: bigint

3

Data Set: Quiz Attempts
Column: AttemptId
Type: bigint

4

Data Set: Checkpoint Definition (future delivery)
Column: CheckpointId
Type: uniqueidentifier

5

Data Set: Portfolio Evidence Objects
Column: EvidenceId
Type: uniqueidentifier

Note: AlignedObjectIds are stored as plain strings in Learning Outcomes data sets, so they must be parsed as the appropriate data type to look up a tool-specific object.
 
Deleting Outcome Objects
When an outcome object is deleted from a course,  the Outcome Details data set will have a non-null value in the IsDeleted field for that object. However, all secondary data set references to that object will still have a null IsDeleted value unless the object context is specifically deleted. 
For example: an outcome is aligned to an assessment activity, has not yet been evaluated, and is deleted from the course intent list. The outcome object will have a non-null  IsDeleted value in Outcome Details, but IsDeleted is still null for the aligned assessment activity in Outcomes Aligned to Tool Objects.
The deletion is implicitly inherited down to child activities, so ensure you check deletion at all levels.
 
Outcome Details
The Outcome Details Brightspace Data Set provides details of the outcomes that are part of all registries in all your org units.
User IDs and dates are only populated for authored outcomes because updates to ASN outcomes rely on the cache invalidation system (performed by a system user).
The only available data for authored outcomes is from June 2021 onwards. All data for ASN imported outcomes is available, starting with your organization's first use of Learning Outcomes.

Virtual Classroom Usage
The Virtual Classroom Usage Brightspace Data Set returns information about how Virtual Classroom by Bongo is being used for Bongo Premium customers. The first data point is from July 1, 2018 and the data set will only appear for Bongo Premium customers if there is usage to retrieve. 
Note: The data includes all Virtual Classroom meetings that have ever been created. Cancelled meetings can be identified using the IsCancelled field, and do not appear in the LTI Links Brightspace Data Set. The Virtual Classroom UI only displays meetings that are scheduled to occur in the future, or have occurred and were recorded.
Note: This data set is available as a FULL CSV containing all of the data and does not include a differential. Data is produced on a weekly basis, regardless of whether you purchased the hourly data freshness add-on. Since the data is owned by Bongo, data set generation is done on a region schedule and may not align to existing schedules.

Learner Usage
About
The Learner Usage data set returns the activity for learners in course offerings. The course offerings must be children of the selected org unit. The learners that are included depend on the date range selected (see note).
About Time Tracking
The time tracking in this report does not align with the SCORM Detailed Report. If a user opens a SCORM package in a new window, the  Total Time Spent in the SCORM Detailed Report will be substantially higher because Learner Usage doesn't track that time. If a user opens a SCORM package in embed mode, the   Total Time Spent in the SCORM Detailed Report will be slightly lower because it only tracks  the time users spend interacting with the SCORM Object, whereas Learner Usage Report tracks the entire session.
About SCORM Dates
If a user clicks on a legacy SCORM topic it will be marked as completed, even if the user has not progressed through the entire topic and has a SCORM Report showing incomplete. This means that a user who visits a legacy SCORM topic will get both a Last SCORM Visit Date and a Last SCORM Completion Date

Note: Calculating Content Required
The number in the Content Required column is calculated by first counting all topics in the course offering, then subtracting topics for each learner if they meet any of the following criteria:

The topic's completion method is Optional.


The topic's visibility status is Hidden.


The learner hasn't met release conditions for the topic.


The assignment or quiz topic has been restricted to specific people and the learner doesn't have access.


Any of the parent modules in the hierarchy above the topic has a visibility status of Hidden.


The parent forum of a discussion topic has a visibility status of Hidden.


The discussion topic has been restricted to a group that doesn't include the learner.


The discussion topic or forum has availability date(s) that  are outside the current date and is marked 'Hidden before start' or 'Hidden after end'.


The assignment topic is a group assignment and the learner isn't a member of any group associated with the assignment.


The assignment topic has availability date(s) that  are outside the current date and is marked 'Hidden before start' or 'Hidden after end'.


The learner doesn't have permission to use the tool associated with the content topic.


The learner is exempt from the topic.


The topic is a broken link.


The topic is a shared LTI link and the link is no longer shared.


The topic is deleted.

 
Note: Calculating Content Completed
The number in the Content Completed column is calculated using the same method as Content Required, but only counts the topics that the learner has completed.

Competency Reporting with PLOE Advanced Data Set

Introduction to PLOE
The Program Learning Outcome Evaluation (PLOE) advanced data set is designed to provide program-level (or similar) competency achievement data. The learning outcome objects within the learning environment must be created at multiple organizational levels within the Brightspace hierarchy.
This document discusses each of these object types, the level at which they should be created, and the methodology which should be used for their creation. PLOE only works with the Brightspace Competency tool and not the Brightspace Learning Outcomes tool.
Requirements

The Competency tool must be turned on.


The Learning Outcomes tool must be turned off. Admin Tools menu > click Organization Tools > Availability tab > locate Learning Outcomes in the list and disable it using the slider on the right.


Data Hub must be available 


Give approved roles permission (Can execute PLOE) to see PLOE.


Organizational structure must be created to accommodate program level competencies (details below).


Program org unit type must be created.


Configuration variables must be set (d2l.Tools.AdvancedDataSets.ProgramOrgUnitTypeId(Org) to the program org unit type ID.

Program Level Organization Structure Considerations
The competency objects within the learning environment will need to be created at multiple organizational levels.  This documentation will discuss each of these object types, the level at which they should be created and the methodology which should be used for their creation.
Program level org units will be required to be built within the organization structure to provide reporting of learning outcome achievement at that level and to provide segmentation of the achievements of learners between programs.
Program org units can be created manually from the Org Unit Editor from the Admin Tools.  The org unit type for Program will need to be added in the Org Unit Type Editor (if not already existing) by adding an org unit with the name “Program” (or similar).  Then individual org units of type “Program” can then be created in the org structure.  This would be accomplished by using the Org Unit Editor and creating a child org unit under the main organization (“Org”) level of type  “Program”.
The children of the program org unit will be the course templates of the course offerings offered within the program. To add the children, navigate to the new program org unit in the Org Unit Editor and select the option to Add a Child.  The course templates can be entered by name or by org unit ID (or “ou number”).  This ou number is displayed in the left-hand organization tree pane of the Org Unit Editor in parentheses following the org unit name.
Program Level Enrollment
Learners will need to be enrolled into the program org unit associated with the outcome structure in order for their achievements to be reported.  This enrollment can happen using different methods.  The easiest method is using the Bulk User Management tool from the Admin Tools menu.  This tool accepts a CSV file specifying the enrollments to process.  Other methods of creating program enrollments include the Brightspace application APIs (“Valence”) or with D2L Standard CSV (v2 or higher).  An enrollment API route is available to enroll users into any org unit within the learning environment.  Other options could also be available for your specific use case. D2L Standard CSV is often used as part of a system of record (SIS, HRIS or CRM) integration, but can also be used standalone if needed.
Regardless of the enrollment method selected, the learner enrollment into this org unit level is completely invisible to the learner and has no impact on their interactions with the learning environment.
Program Level Objects
Program level competencies need to be created using the Competency tool from the proper program organizational unit.  These objects are represented in the illustrations by a blue tipped triangle       . These competency objects should remain in draft status until the entire structure has been created & reviewed.  Once everything has been created and reviewed, then all the competency objects will need to be updated to the approved status.
Competency objects created at the program level will represent overall program outcomes to be achieved by students by the completion of the program.  These program outcome objects will have learning objective children from the course template level of each course.  The competency objects created at this program level need to be made available (shared) to all its child descendants of type Course Template (see the competency object settings section below).
Review the illustration provided in Appendix B – Competency Structure Diagram for additional examples of construction methodology in the competency structure.
Competency Object Settings
When the competency objects are created, there are some selections on the properties of the competency that should be set.

Figure: Competency object settings.
The “Make competency and its children visible to users” must be checked for the competency and its children learning objectives to be visible to the instructors for linking of learning activities.
The “Allow re-evaluation of users who have achieved this competency” must be checked for the competency achievement to be re-calculated when changes are made to the learning activities or anywhere within the child/parent structure under this competency.
Use the “Make Competency Available To” section to publish or share the competency and its children to the appropriate org unit level.  In general, competency objects should only be shared down one level within the organization structure.  Competency objects created at the Program level will be shared to the Course Template level.  A secondary competency object (called the “Bridge Competency”) will be created at the Course Template level and shared down to the Course Offering level (see the section on Course Template Level Objects below.) Only one Bridge Competency is needed per Course Template.
When selecting the Add Org Units button, a new window will appear.  For ease of searching you can use the Show Search Options and filter for the specific org unit type that you wish to select.  In this stage of the selection you should locate the current org level type where this competency object is being defined.

Figure: Add Org Units' search parameters.
Once the proper org unit type objects are displayed, select the current org unit (the one in which the current competency object is being defined) and then in the Options column select “All descendants of type:  Course Template”.

Figure: Program Add Org Units all descendant of type.
Then select the Insert button to save your selection.
The “Achievement Criteria” field allows the achievement of this competency to be based on successful achievement of “ANY” or “ALL” in the children org units.  The default value for this setting is “Any one org unit” and would typically be left on  this setting allowing the achievement of this competency to take place from any of the children org units linking to it.  A supplemental diagram below demonstrates the ‘ANY’ or ‘ALL’ configuration. If ‘ALL’ is chosen, enrollments into each of the courses were the competency is located will be required to achieve the competency. The diagram below demonstrates the differences between ‘ANY’ and ‘ALL’.

Figure: Competency "Any" Model versus Competency "All" Model.
Course Template Level
The use of consolidated course templates in the learning environment will provide the ability to aggregate the learning outcome achievement across multiple sections of a course and across multiple terms.  This can be accomplished if the Course Templates are structured such that all sections of a course are children of one common course template for that course (including any master courses).  To fully support this reporting capability, learning objective objects should be created at the course template level to represent the outcomes which will be achieved within the scope of the course regardless of the section (instructor, modality, term, etc.).
Course Template Level Objects
Course template level learning objectives need to be created using the Competency tool from the course template level org unit.  These objects are represented in the illustrations by a yellow striped triangle      . These objects should remain in draft status until the entire structure has been created & reviewed.  One learning objective object should be created at this level for each student learning outcome (or knowledge indicator) which will be evaluated within the scope of the course curriculum.  The parent of these learning objective objects should be their associated competency objects at the program level.  A second parent of each  learning objective will be the course level competency object (called the “Bridge Competency”) which will be shared to all of the course offerings (see below).
The bridge competency is created at the course template level.  This learning object will be a competency and will be a parent to all of the learning objectives created for this course.  This course competency object will be shared to all course offerings under the course template.  This course competency provides visibility of the learning objectives at the course template level to all current and future course offerings created under this template.  This competency object does not require any parents and will have only children as the learning objectives which are created at the same level.
*Only 1 bridge per course template is needed.

Figure: Course Template for Add Org Units all descendants of type.
Each learning objective object within the course template level will have at a minimum two parents.  One parent will be the bridge competency created at the course template level.  The second (and any other) parent(s) will be the competency objects shared down from the program level.
When creating learning objective objects, it is recommended that the Enforced Assessment Method setting be left as No.  No is the default value for this setting.  If this setting is set to Yes and one or more tools are selected, then this learning objective is only available for assessment within the selected tools.
NOTE:  This setting cannot be changed.  A new learning objective must be created and inserted into the competency structure if a different enforced assessment method is needed.

Figure: Learning Objective Enforced Assessment Method.
Also, when creating new learning objectives, the Ready for Evaluation setting should be set to Yes.  The default value for this setting is No.  Learning objective achievement is not tracked for learning objectives in the No status.  There is no functional benefit to leaving this object set as a “No” status.  So, best practice is to set this status to Yes as new objectives are created.  This eliminates one update step later in the process (which would be to manually set the status on these objects to Yes).

Figure: Learning Objective Ready for Evaluation.
Course Offering Level Objects
Within the course offering level the assigned learning activities will be created as normal.  These learning activity objects are identified in the illustrations with a red based triangle . Each activity which has been identified as a critical assessment activity (or one in which successful achievement is required to properly achieve an identified course performance or knowledge indicator) must be associated with the proper learning objective at the course template level.  This association is defined on the Objectives tab of the learning activity within the learning environment.  Be sure to check the box selecting the activity as required and define the proper achievement threshold.
NOTE:  It is important that the rubric evaluation to be used for outcome achievement be associated on the Objectives tab and NOT defined on the Properties tab.  The rubric association that can be made on the Properties tab is to support grading only.  The rubric association on the Objectives tab will support both outcome achievement and grading.
If your institution uses a “Master Course” construct, then the critical assessment activities within the master course can be associated with the learning objectives.  That master course can then be copied into each of the individual course shells for the various course offering sections.  The association between the critical assessment activity and the learning objective will be copied into the new course shell as long as the master course is a child of the same template where the course shells are created.
NOTE:  Learning Objectives at the course template level must be set as ready for evaluation before they are available to be associated with course offering level learning activities.
NOTE:  All learning activities within a course offering which are linked to a learning objective are joined in an AND relationship which means that all activities under a learning objective (within a course offering) must be achieved in order for the parent learning objective to be achieved.
Assignment Activities
*If using the ‘New Assignment Experience’, the below information will vary.
Assignment activities can be evaluated using a rubric assessment.  A holistic or analytic rubric can be defined for this assessment.  A holistic rubric provides a single element evaluation method (similar to a grade only evaluation).  An analytic rubric provides a two-dimensional evaluation where multiple criteria can be evaluated at multiple achievement levels.  If an analytic rubric is used for this assessment, then the outcome achievement can be associated with the overall rubric performance or with one individual criterion.  An achievement threshold must be defined to designate what the success criteria are for satisfactory completion of the indicator being evaluated.
Multiple learning objectives can be associated with an individual learning activity if the activity supports achievement of more than one indicator.
When attaching a rubric to an assignment folder, DO NOT attach the rubric on the properties tab of the assignment unless the rubric is being used for grading only.  Rubrics must be associated on the Objectives tab with the learning objective if outcomes achievement data is to be collected.  Rubrics associated on the Objectives tab can be used for both grading and outcomes achievement data collection.
NOTE: Create the rubric to be used for evaluation before continuing to link the assignment activity to the learning objective.
To associate the learning objective, select the Objectives tab and then select the Associate Learning Objectives button.

Figure: Associate Learning Objectives.
Then select one or more learning objectives from the list of learning objectives which is displayed.

Figure: Select Learning Objective.
After the learning objective(s) is/are added to the activity, the parameters of the assessment for each learning objective must be defined.  These parameters are defined under the Action menu (the drop-down arrow on the right side) next to each learning objective.  Select Add Assessment from the action menu.

Figure: Add Assessment.
In the Assessment parameters window, select the rubric to be used for evaluation.

Figure: Define Assessment Parameters.
From the Criteria drop-down list, select whether the overall rubric score or an individual criterion evaluation level should be used to determine achievement of this learning objective.

Figure: Select rubric criterion or overall score.
Check the box which indicates that this activity is required.  This checkbox must be selected to collect achievement data for this activity.  If this box is not selected, then the outcome achievement data is not collected.  An achievement threshold for this activity can only be defined once this checkbox is selected.  The achievement threshold value is not displayed until the check box is selected.
Select the minimum level of acceptable achievement from the rubric evaluation levels.  Any evaluation at this level of performance or higher will constitute achievement of this activity.

Quizzing Activities
Quizzes can be associated with the achievement of one or more learning objectives at the course template level.  If the Quiz is automatically graded, then the achievement of the learning objective an also be automatically evaluated.  Numeric evaluation is available for quiz activities.  When the quiz is associated with the learning objective it must be marked as required and a minimum achievement score must be defined.
Quizzes can be associated with learning objectives in the following manners:
•	The entire quiz score
•	The score on a particular quiz section (including random question sections)
•	The score on one or more selected quiz questions
To associate the learning objective, select the Objectives tab and then select the Associate Learning Objectives button.

Figure: Associate Questions or Sections.
In the windows which is displayed, select one or more learning objectives to be evaluated in this quiz.  Select the Associate Learning objectives button to add the selected learning objectives to the quiz.
Next, select question, set of questions, section or entire quiz which should be associated with this learning objective.

Figure: Select Questions and/or Sections.
Select Associate Questions to save the selected questions and/or sections.
Then, select the drop-down action menu to define the parameters of the assessment.  Select the Add Assessment option to define the parameters of the assessment.

Figure: Add Assessment.
Define the parameters of the assessment.  Be sure to check the box to indicate that the activity is required which will display the achievement threshold and trigger collection of the assessment data.

Figure: Define Assessment Parameters.
The achievement perspective on a quiz reflects the percentage (or score) of correct questions out of the selected questions (or total quiz score – depending on how the assessment is configured).  So, for example, in a quiz with 20 questions, if 3 questions are selected to be associated one learning objective, each question would be equivalent to a 33 1/3 percentage achievement assuming equal weighing of the questions.  The questions are accumulated on a 100 points basis for the selected questions.  So, if an achievement threshold is defined as greater than or equal to 75%, for example, a student would have to successfully answer all three questions to achieve a score on those questions which met or exceeded the threshold (2 correct questions would only be 66.67%).
Grade Book and Discussion Activities
Individual grade book items and discussion threads can also be associated with learning objectives from the course template level.  When defining this association for a grade book item you can choose whether the evaluation method will be a numeric or a rubric assessment.  With enhancements released in the May, 2018 CD Update, grade items with rubrics directly associated in the gradebook can no longer be tied to assessment activities.  If you had previously associated rubrics to the grade item for an assessment activity, those rubric associations should be relocated to the individual assessment.
When defining the association for a discussion thread, a rubric evaluation can be used.  Enhancements to the rubric evaluation process in discussions have been released in the May, 2018 CD Update.  These enhancements now allow a rubric to be associated directly on the Objectives tab of the Discussion Forum.  The rubric evaluation will automatically be displayed to the learner in the gradebook and in the User Progress tool.
Rubrics
It is important to consider rubrics in conjunction with the learning outcome assessment implementation as an integrated piece of the project.  Rubrics are the assessment tool used to evaluate the successful achievement of the learning outcome and as such are an integral part of the assessment project.
Internal standards should be developed in the construction of analytic rubrics.  All rubrics within the organization should be consistently structured either with the first column on the left being the highest evaluation level moving toward the lowest on the right or vice-a-versa.  The performance reports will not be able to properly aggregate the achievement results if some of the rubrics are structured in one manner and some are in the other.
BEST PRACTICE:  It is recommended that analytic rubrics within a program be constructed using the same number of evaluation levels and using the same terminology to represent those levels.  From a student perspective, consistently across evaluation tools is extremely helpful and aids in their understanding of performance expectations.
The criteria being evaluated within the rubrics can vary based on the purpose and use of each rubric.  Consistency again is recommended so if faculty within a program can collectively agree on the use of standardized rubrics where possible within a program it will not only aid student comprehension and achievement but also aid performance reporting.
BEST PRACTICE:  It is recommended that rubrics be limited to between three and five criteria whenever possible.  Increasingly complex rubrics with multiple criteria being evaluated result in increased difficulty for the students to successfully achieve all of the required criteria.
Activation
Once the entire structure has been created, reviewed and approved, all competency objects must be set to “Approved” status before the achievement results can be accumulated and reported.
Retrieving PLOE Data
To retrieve the PLOE advanced data set, you will need to provide the organizational unit code where the parent competency resides. For example, if the program competency is located at the program level 6945, that value will be inputted into the Org Unit ID filter in the PLOE parameter.

About engagement and session length data

Our research shows that the following questions are the most important to you when it comes to how users engage with Brightspace:

When was the last time someone accessed the platform?


How does that access trend over time?


How long does the access last?

If you're trying to report on engagement in  your organization, there are several data sets available in Data Hub to choose from. This topic outlines the different engagement metrics and what they capture, so you can decide which is best suited to your reporting needs.
Engagement Metrics
System Access (System Access Log BDS):

Begins when the user logs in to Brightspace, launches the app, or returns after 30 minutes of inactivity.


Ends when the user logs out, after 30 minutes of inactivity, or the session is force ended by an administrator.


Includes activity from Brightspace, Pulse, and Brightspace Parent & Guardian app.

 
Session (Session History BDS):

Begins when the user logs in to Brightspace.


Ends when the session times out (determined by the d2l.SessionTimeout config variable), the user logs out, or the session is force ended by an administrator.


Includes activity from Brightspace only.

 
Login (User Logins BDS):

Begins when the user logs in to Brightspace or enters their credentials in the app.


Ends: not captured.


Includes activity from Brightspace, Pulse, and Brightspace Parent & Guardian app.

Note: When a user logs in to one of our apps for the first time, a persistent authorization token is generated which allows them to open the app without logging in. This makes logins an unreliable metric for tracking engagement with our apps.
 
Course Access (Course Access BDS):

Begins when the user visits a course in Brightspace for the first time that day.


Ends: not captured.


Includes activity from Brightspace only.

 
Course Access Log (Course Access Log BDS):

Begins when the user visits a course in Pulse for the first time that day and creates additional rows for every 30 minutes that the user spends in the course, or returns after 30 minutes of inactivity.


Ends: not captured.


Includes activity from Pulse only.

 
Frequently Asked Questions
1. If I have Brightspace open in multiple windows or multiple browsers, are they counted as independent system accesses?
If you have two instances of Brightspace open in different windows or tabs of the same browser, that counts as one system access.
If you have two instances of Brightspace open in two different browsers (for example: Firefox and Safari), that counts as two separate system accesses.
 
2. What kind of activity keeps my system access from timing out?
Navigating to different pages, clicking something that auto-saves, and typing in a Written Response text box are a few examples of actions you can take to keep your system access active. Even if you sit and do nothing for 30 minutes, a popup that reads “ARE YOU STILL THERE?” appears, and you can click anywhere or press any key to renew your session. Moving the cursor or clicking randomly isn’t enough to keep your system access from timing out.
 
3. What does it mean when a row in System Access Log for the start of a system access has no corresponding row for the end of the system access?
It means the system access timed out and the user took no action before the backend cleanup task deleted the session. This commonly happens when a user closes the tab or browser without logging out, or leaves the browser unattended for several hours.
 
4. What does it mean when a row in the Session History data has the exact same date and time in the DateStarted and LastAccessed columns?
It means the user logged in to Brightspace, didn’t take any actions to keep the session active, and the session timed out.

Roles that are granted permission to see a dashboard see data for each org unit in which they are enrolled with dashboard permissions unless otherwise specified in the details for the dashboard cards. In some cases, aggregated data at a higher level appears for all users. When a user attempts to drill deeper into the data, only data for the org unit(s) or user(s) for which they have permissions appears on the dashboard.



--------------------------------------------------


Adoption Dashboard

This dashboard provides visualizations to help administrators understand how users in their organization adopt Brightspace.
To see the Adoption Dashboard, your role must have the Can See Adoption Dashboard permission. Users will see aggregated data across the entire organization down to course level data for courses where they are enrolled. No user-level data is included in this dashboard.
The current Adoption Dashboard experience was released in Brightspace Platform July 2022/20.22.7 with an updated user interface, improved accessibility features, ability to filter data and interact with the cards, and a new visualization for tool usage by role.
Figure: New Adoption Dashboard landing page, with "Export to CSV" button in the top right, filters for Org Unit, Role, Tool, Start Date, and End Date near the top, "Access" section, and "Tools Usage" section. Enrollment and Withdrawal section not pictured.
You can export the data from the dashboard by clicking Export to CSV on the top right of the dashboard. The filters you selected are respected and applied to the exported data.
In the More Options  (...) menu in the top right of the dashboard, click Settings to open the Settings page where you can find descriptions of the data presented in each cards and select which cards to display or hide on the dashboard.
Figure: The new Settings page, with all cards selected.
In the More Options  (...) menu, click Learn More to navigate to the documentation about the data included in the dashboard.
Filters
The landing page by default displays visualizations combining data from your entire organization, with a date range of the most recent 2 weeks. Use the filters to narrow down the scope of the data to specific org units, roles, tools, and time periods that you are interested in. When you apply a filter, all charts adjust to display the corresponding filtered data. The filter drop-downs show the number of selections that are currently applied to the dashboard. Click Clear Filters to reset the dashboard to its original state.
The Org Unit filter allows you to isolate any portions of your organization that you have access to, with a maximum of 100 individual selections. All Tools and Roles are accessible in their respective filters. You can use the Date filter to look at different date ranges, with a maximum of 6 months at a time.
Each time you interact with the dashboard filters, the URL is updated. This means you can use your browser's Back button to go back one step and undo the selection you just made. You can also bookmark or share the URL to return to the same filtered view later.
Interacting with cards on the dashboard to drill down or zoom in to the data does not change the filters or the URL.
System Access
The System Access card displays a line graph of the number of system accesses on each day of the date range for all  roles included in the filter. The Org Unit filter has no effect on this visualization because system access occurs at the organization level, not the individual course level. For more information about how we calculate System Access, refer to What is the new System Access metric and how do I use it? in Brightspace Community.
Interactions:

Click and drag to zoom into a shorter time period.


Hover your cursor over a data point to highlight it and read its hover text.

Course Access Counts
The Course Access Counts card displays a stacked bar chart showing how many times the courses under each org unit have been visited during the date range, with different colors representing the roles of the users accessing courses. By default, it displays the highest-level org units that are the direct children of the overall organization.
Interactions:

Click Sort in the top right corner of the card to change the order in which the data is presented. The default sorting method is Org Unit ID, low to high.


Click on an org unit in the chart to see the course access breakdown for the children of that org unit. Navigation breadcrumbs appear in the top left of the card to show your position in the org unit hierarchy.

You can continue drilling down through org units until you reach the course offering level. For example, if the highest-level org units at a school are the faculties, you can click Faculty of Science to see course access for all science departments, then you can click Physics Department to see course access for all physics course offerings. You cannot go deeper to compare different sections of the same course offering.



Click on a role in one of the bars in the chart to highlight all the data for that role and grey out all other roles. This also highlights that role in all other applicable cards on the dashboard and causes a Showing Only: tag to appear at the top of the dashboard.


Hover your cursor over a data point to highlight it and read its hover text.

Tool Usage Trend by Tool
The Tool Usage Trend by Tool card displays a stacked area graph of the number of times each tool was used on each day of the date range, with different colors representing different tools.
Interactions:

Click and drag to zoom into a shorter time period.


Click on a tool's area in the graph to highlight all the data for that tool and and grey out all other tools. This also highlights that tool in all other applicable cards on the dashboard and causes a Showing Only: tag to appear at the top of the dashboard.


Hover your cursor over a data point to highlight it and read its hover text.

Tool Usage Trend by Role
The Tool Usage Trend by Role card displays a stacked area graph of the number of tool uses  on each day of the date range, with different colors representing the roles of the users using the tools. By providing information about how different user roles and org units are using the available tools, you can measure the success of adoption campaigns and the use of key tools.
Interactions:

Click and drag to zoom into a shorter time period.

Tool Usage Comparison
The Tool Usage Comparison card displays a stacked bar chart showing how many times various tools have been used within each org unit during the date range, with different colors representing different tools. The visualization displays the highest-level org units by default.
Interactions:

Click Sort in the top right corner of the card to change the order in which the data is presented. The default sorting method is Org Unit ID, low to high.


Click on an org unit in the chart to see the course access breakdown for the children of that org unit. Navigation breadcrumbs appear in the top left of the card to show your position in the org unit hierarchy. 

You can continue drilling down into the children of those org units until you reach the course offering level, just like the Course Access Counts card.



Click on a tool in one of the bars in the chart to highlight all the data for that tool and and grey out all other tools. This also highlights that tool in all other applicable cards on the dashboard and causes a Showing Only: tag to appear at the top of the dashboard.


Hover your cursor over a data point to highlight it and read its hover text.

Enrollments & Withdrawals
The Enrollments & Withdrawals card displays a line graph showing the number of enrollments and withdrawals during the date range within the selected org units, with separate lines for enrollments and withdrawals. The information on this visualization can help users understand patterns of course enrollments and withdrawals for both regular enrollment and rolling enrollments, and provide information about key dates such as semester start and the last day to drop a course. In addition, it can provide insight about spikes that may be due to other underlying issues. The Role filter has no impact on this card.
Interactions:

Click and drag to zoom into a shorter time period.


Hover your cursor over a data point to highlight it and read its hover text.

Note: On the Adoption Dashboard, a withdrawal is treated as an explicit un-enrollment from a course and does not reflect if a learner’s status is changed from active to inactive.



--------------------------------------------------


Assessment Quality Dashboard

This dashboard provides visualizations to help users understand the quality of assessments using quiz and question statistics such as reliability, average grade, and correlation for all quiz and question types. 
The Assessment Quality Dashboard is available to all clients who have the Performance+ package or who have purchased Brightspace Insights in the previous packaging model.
To see the Assessment Quality Dashboard, your role must have the Can See Assessment Quality Dashboard  permission, and you must be enrolled in the course offerings whose  assessments you want to see. Quizzes need at least one attempt to be included in the dashboard.
Viewing and interacting with the Assessment Quality Dashboard
The dashboard has 3 views: the landing page, the Quiz Item Analysis area, and the Preview Question area. The dashboard contains the following functionality:

Org Unit filtering, which allows filtering of data across different org unit levels.

Interactive cards and visualizations that enable you to filter through the available data.
Accessibility features: visual cues like filter tags and toast messages, support for screen readers, and keyboard navigation.
Pagination, which enables you to define the number of results per view and easily sequence the results.
The ability to export data as a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file.
Link to the Quiz Edit page for quick actions.
In general, when using quiz and question statistics, it is important to keep in mind the sample size for the given quiz or question. Metrics increase in statistical relevance as the sample size increases.
The landing page
The landing page  shows you visualizations combining the data from all the quizzes that you manage. The data on this page enables you to analyze and identify quizzes that are underperforming in terms of grade scores and reliability.

Figure: Assessment Quality Dashboard landing page.
Under Summary, there are cards for Results (the number of quizzes that you manage and meet the criteria applied to the dashboard), Average Score, Flagged Question (the number of quizzes with one or more questions that are outside the set threshold for acceptable values), and Quiz Reliability. You can turn these cards on and off and adjust the thresholds in Settings.
The Quiz Details area contains a dynamic table of quizzes that meet the criteria applied to the dashboard.  An "!" icon appears next to quizzes that have one or more flagged questions. Click on any of the quizzes in this table to navigate to the Quiz Item Analysis page for that quiz.
If you want to compare multiple occurrences of the same quiz to see how the statistics vary, enter the name of the quiz in the search input above the quiz table. This applies a filter to the entire dashboard. Quizzes only display if their  name matches your search, and  org units only display if they contain a quiz whose name matches your search. The search input has truncation limits of 5,000 org units and 50,000 quizzes, so if you have access to a very large number of org units, we advise filtering by org unit prior to filtering by quiz name for best results.
The Quiz Details table includes the following:
Column Name
Column Description
Quiz
Name of the quiz, truncated to 160 characters, and unique identifier. Also includes the name and ID of the course offering it is a part of.
Average Score
Calculated as a percentage using the score for each user's first attempt at the quiz.
Reliability Coefficient

Reliability is calculated for all questions whether the quiz questions are all dichotomous or not. Reliability will usually range from 0 to 1, but negative values are possible.
Note: For more information about how the reliability coefficient is calculated, see Calculating Reliability, below.

Number of Quiz Items
Total number of questions in the quiz.
Flagged Quiz Items
Number of questions that are outside the set threshold for acceptable values in the quiz.
Number of Learner Answers
Number of distinct users who have attempted the quiz.
Calculating reliability
In the Assessment Quality Dashboard, for every course, there is a reliability coefficient for each quiz that has one attempt. Reliability is calculated for all questions, whether the quiz questions have two possible answers (such as true or false) or not. Reliability ranges from 0-1; however, negative values are possible. 
Reliability is calculated as follows: 

Where:

k = total number of questions in the quiz.
(σ_(question i) )2 = the variance for a particular question score i
(σ_(quiz,all) )2 = the variance of the quiz scores (based on all learners)

The Quiz Item Analysis area
Click on a quiz to navigate to the Quiz Item Analysis area, which provides a breakdown of each question in a quiz.

Figure: The Quiz Item Analysis area.
Click on Go to quiz under the name of the quiz, and the Edit Quiz page opens in a new window.
Under Summary, there are cards for Quiz Details which includes the details from the previous page, Low Mean which counts the number of quiz items with a mean lower than your threshold, High Deviation which counts the number of quiz items with a deviation greater than your threshold, Weak Correlation which counts the number of quiz items with a correlation lower than your threshold, and High Discrimination which counts the quiz items with a wide gap between low and high performers. You can turn these cards on and off and alter the thresholds in Settings.
The Quiz Items area contains a dynamic table of quiz items that meet the criteria applied to the dashboard. An "!" icon appears next to quizzes that have one or more statistics out of range of the set threshold. Click on any of the quiz items in this table to navigate to the Preview Question page for that quiz item.
The Quiz Items table displays statistics and details about each question in the quiz, including:
Column Name
Column Description
Question
Question text, truncated to 70 characters, and a unique identifier.
Mean
Calculated as a percentage to two decimal places using the score for each user's first attempt at the question.
Top Incorrect Answer
Most frequently reported incorrect answer. Only populated for multiple choice and true or false questions.
Top Incorrect Answer Rate
Response rate between 0 and 1 for those who selected the most common incorrect answer. Only populated for multiple choice and true or false questions.
In Question Pool
Indicates if the question is part of a question pool (yes or no).
Standard Deviation
The standard deviation of the grade of the question using each user's first attempt.
Correlation

This calculates any possible correlation between the question score and the total quiz score. Displays N/A when all users answer the question correctly.
Note: For more information,  see Calculating Correlation, below.

Discrimination Index
This calculates any possible discrimination in the question between the higher and lower performing learners by subtracting the question's lower 27% from its upper 27%. The higher the difference, the better the question discriminates between high and low performing learners. A negative value indicates that more low performing learners are correctly answering the question than high performing learners. This would most likely indicate a flawed quiz question.
Upper 27%

Average question grade of the users with quiz grades in the top 27%.
Note: when there are 10 or fewer question attempts, the upper and lower 50% is considered instead of 27%. This makes the statistic relevant with smaller sample sizes.

Lower 27%
Average question grade of the users with quiz grades in the lowest 27%.
Calculating correlation
Correlation values in the Assessment dashboard show the correlation between the question score and the total quiz score. It measures the strength of the correlation between the two values and shows either a positive or a negative relationship ranging from -1.00 to +1.00.
If the question has only two possible answers (dichotomous questions), such as true or false, the dashboard uses point biserial correlation. If the questions are not dichotomous, such as short answer questions, the dashboard calculations are based on Pearson correlation.
Point biserial correlation is calculated as follows: 

Where:

y1=Number of correct answers
y0=Number of incorrect answers
M1= Average quiz score for those with the correct answer
M0= Average quiz score for those with the incorrect answer
n=Number of unique user attempts for the question

 
Pearson Correlation is calculated as follows:

Where :
n=Number of unique user attempts for the question
a=Question score
b=Quiz score
ai=Individual question scores indexed with i
bi= Individual quiz scores indexed with i


The Preview Question area
Click on a quiz question to navigate to the Preview Question area, where you can preview quiz questions, comments, and hints.

Figure: The Preview Question area.
About Rounding
For all of the metrics on the Assessment Quality Dashboard, rounding is performed only once, at the end of the calculation. Different metrics have different numbers of final decimal places. If the digit in the final decimal place is followed by digit greater than or equal to 5, it is rounded up; if followed by a digit smaller than 5, it remains as-is.
For example, 1.2356 rounded to 2 decimal places becomes 1.24, while 1.2345 becomes 1.23.

The Engagement Dashboard contains visualizations that provide insight into how learners are engaging with their courses. The goal of this dashboard is to help users, primarily instructors and advisers, to identify at-risk learners so that they can intervene  and get learners back on track. The information provided in the dashboard allows for individualized improvement suggestions  by providing context and a holistic view of the learner. By filtering out irrelevant data and combining metrics by filtering on cards, users can focus on their own definition of an at-risk learner.
Viewing and Interacting with the Engagement Dashboard
The dashboard contains 3 main sections:
Filters, which appear as dropdown menus for Org Unit and Semester. If you click a data point in a chart in the Summary View to further filter report content, those filters are also listed in this area. 
The Summary View includes the Results summary, Discussion Activity pie chart, Overdue Assignments summary, System Access summary, Current Grade bar chart, Time in Content  vs. Grade scatterplot, Course Access bar chart, and Content View bar chart.
The Results area that contains a dynamic user table of learners who meet the criteria applied to the dashboard. As you add filters to the summary data, the learners listed in the User Table automatically change to reflect the updated Summary view.

Figure: The Summary View of the Engagement Dashboard.
By default, the 10 most recently accessed courses within the 3 most recently created semesters appear on the report the first time you load the dashboard. A pop-up appears when you first access the Engagement Dashboard that summarizes what displays in the default view. The Org Unit drop down filter includes a list of all courses in the Org Unit, with the 10 most recently accessed courses within the 3 most recently created semesters selected.

Figure: Add or remove org unit and semester filters using the dropdown filters.
You can dynamically add or remove courses and other org units such as school, campus, department and so on, by clicking the check box beside the org unit name. You can also limit the dashboard query results to specific semesters (sorted by date) or roles within your organization.
If the auditor permission path is enabled, auditors (users with an existing auditor relationship) will only see user-level data about the learners they audit.
Note: When you filter by All Org Units in an organization, if there is only one org unit in a branch that is not a course offering, that org unit does not appear; only branches with more than one item appear. For example, if an organization has a structure of district, board, school, grade, and course, a user in a specific school does not need access to the structure above the school. The org structure prunes the district, board, and school to reduce the number of times a user clicks to browse to the org structure that is applicable to them.
When you interact with cards or filters, any filters you apply are saved to the URL. You can bookmark views in your browser and return to the same view in the future. If you share the URL with another user, note that their permissions may differ and cause them to see different results with the same link.
Using the Summary View

Figure:  Summary information about the dashboard in the upper left quadrant of the dashboard.
The Results block indicates the number of learners represented by the charts in the dashboard. This is the number of learners that appears in the user table in the Results section at the bottom of the dashboard.
The Discussion Activity pie chart indicates the number of discussions created, replied to, and read. If you hover over a pie segment, a pop-up appears with a number and description of the segment. This is helpful for understanding the proportion of passive and active social engagement. If you click a segment, the rest of the Engagement dashboard automatically filters the returned data for the learners represented by the segment. This is also summarized in the results table.
The Overdue Assignments card displays the number of learners meeting the filters applied to the dashboard who have one or more overdue assignments. If you apply filters to the dashboard content, this number automatically changes to reflect the learners reflected by the updated data. 
Note: Group assignments are not included in the Overdue Assignments metrics.
The System Access card indicates the number of learners who have not accessed the system in the previous 14 days. Access is counted whether the learner is using the Brightspace Pulse app or Brightspace in a browser. This is also summarized in the results table.
Using the Current Grade bar chart

Figure: Chart of the number of learners who have achieved grades, displayed in 10th percentile groupings.
If you click one or more bars, the dashboard filters the returned data for learners and courses where the learner has a grade in the selected range.  For example, the following image shows the dashboard filtered to include only learners who have less than 60% in a course:

Figure: The Current Grade chart dynamically changes to reflect the applied filter. The Summary information also changes to reflect the filtered data.
Using the Time in Content vs. Grade scatterplot

Figure: The chart plots learners’ grades against the amount of time they spend in the content.
If you click a quadrant, the dashboard filters on the learners and their courses in that quadrant.
Data points in the top left quadrant plot learners that have an above average grade and spend below average time in the content.
Data points in the top right quadrant plot learners that have an above average grade and spend above average time in the content.
Data points in the lower left quadrant plot learners that have a below average grade and spend below average time in the content.
Data points in the lower right quadrant plot learners  that have a below average grade and spend above average time in the content.
To view the details for the quadrant, hover over the quadrant:

Figure: When you hover over a quadrant, information about the number of learners in the quadrant appears in a popup
When you apply filters to the report, the scatterplot also changes to reflect the new query results. For example, if you apply the filter for learners who have less than 60% in a course that we used earlier, the scatterplot also dynamically changes to represent that filter.

Figure: The Time in Content vs Grade scatterplot dynamically changes to reflect the applied filter. The Summary information also changes to reflect the filtered data, as in the same example above.
Using the Course Access chart
The Course Access bar chart indicates the number of days since learners last accessed the course.

Figure: If you hover over one of the Course Access bars, a pop-up appears with detailed information about the bar.
If you click one or more bars, the dashboard filters the returned data for the learners and courses where the learner has accessed a course in that time range.
Note: Depending on the filters you applied, a learner could be counted in more than one date range, and/or more than once in a single date range if they are enrolled in multiple courses.
You can use more than one filter on the Engagement Dashboard to display more precise, relevant information. For example, if you apply the filter for learners who have less than 60% in the course that you previously used, you might also apply a filter on the Course Access bar graph to further refine the dashboard results to learners who have never accessed the course:

Figure: Laying additional filters results in updates to the other charts on the dashboard to reflect the filtered data, as in the examples above.
Using the Content View chart
The Content View bar chart aggregates the number of times learners looked at course content.

Figure: The Content View chart shows how many times learners visited course content.
It allows you to review how many times items in the course content tool, such as images, PDFs, or Word files, have been viewed to better understand content viewed offline or that was downloaded.
If you click one or more bars, the dashboard filters the returned data for the learners and courses where the learner visited a course the specified number of times.
Using the table in the Results section
The default view of the user list table contains all the users reflected in the dashboard query results. When you change the courses displayed on the dashboard or apply filters, the users that appear in the table also change to display those reflected in the new query results.
For each user, the following information is included in the table:
First and last name, username and Userid
Number of the user’s courses reflected in the query results
Average grade across the user's courses reflected in the query results
Average time in the content for the courses reflected in the query results
Average discussion activity for threads created, threads read, and replies for the courses reflected in the query results.
The last time the learner accessed the system.
Note: If there is a predicted grade for the learner, it appears for all users who can see the dashboard. 
At the bottom of the list, there is a total number of users:

Figure: The Total Users number is also reflected in the Summary information.
You can click a user in the results table to see their Learner Engagement Dashboard, and learn more about engagement across their courses without aggregating the data from other learners. Any filters you apply to the Engagement Dashboard will persist when you navigate to the Learner Engagement Dashboard.
Exporting user query results
Users can export the query results so that they can combine the results with other data or perform other analytics on the content. 

Figure: The Export to CSV button on the Engagement Dashboard.
Advisers can email one or more learners directly from the Results section of the Engagement Dashboard, or email a single learner from their Learner Engagement Dashboard.

Figure: The Email button under the Results section of the Engagement Dashboard.
To email learners or export the report query results
Apply the filters you want to use to the cards at the top of the dashboard.
Do one of the following:Click Email and complete the email dialog to email selected users. Note: the See External Email Addresses for <role>, and either Send Emails to External Email Addresses or Send Emails to Internal Email Addresses permissions are required, depending on the type of email type you intend to sendClick Export to CSV and indicate the export destination location.
Configuring the Engagement Dashboard display using Settings
The Engagement Dashboard Settings page enables you to select which metrics display in  the Engagement Dashboard. The Settings page is available on the More Actions menu.

Figure: The More Actions menu on the top right of the dashboard interface contains the Settings option.
The Settings page has three tabs: Summary Metrics, Result Table Metrics, and User Level Metrics. The Summary Metrics tab contains the Roles filter, which enables you to select the learner roles you want to include in dashboard data. All roles that you exclude are not included in any data query on the Engagement Dashboard. 

Figure: The Roles filter section of the Summary Metrics tab displays a list of all learner roles in your organization; your list may appear differently depending on the roles you are using.
The Summary Metrics tab also enables you to determine which cards are included in the Dashboard display and set your own threshold for the System Access metric. By default, all the cards are included on the dashboard.

Figure: All cards appear in the selection list, and all are selected by default.
The Results Table Metrics tab enables you to set the metrics that display in the Result Detail sections of the dashboard, including Average Grade, Average Time in Content, Average Discussion Participation, and Last System Access. Your selections here also determine which columns display under Active Courses and Inactive Courses in the Learner Engagement Dashboard.

Figure: All the Result Table Metrics are selected by default.
The User Level Metrics tab enables you to set the metrics that display in the Learner Engagement Dashboard.



--------------------------------------------------


Learner Engagement Dashboard

The Learner Engagement Dashboard contains visualizations for engagement metrics, such as course activity, assignment status, and course history, for an individual learner across all their courses.
Note: Your Engagement Dashboard and Learner Engagement Dashboard share the same settings. You have access to users on the Learner Engagement Dashboards  whose role is included in the Role filter setting on the Engagement Dashboard.

Viewing and Interacting with the Learner Engagement Dashboard
This dashboard contains 3 main sections, similar to what appears on the Engagement Dashboard:
Filters for Org Unit and Semester. If you click on a data point in a chart in the Summary View to further filter report content, those filters are also listed in this area. 
The Summary View section includes the Courses in View summary, Average Grade summary, Overdue Assignments summary, System Access summary, Grades Over Time trend chart, Content View Over Time trend chart, and Course Access Over Time trend chart.
The bottom area contains dynamic tables listing the Active Courses and Inactive  Courses that meet the criteria specified by the filters.
As you add filters to the summary data, the visualizations in all the sections  automatically change to reflect the updated Summary view.
Using the Summary View
The Courses in View card displays the number of courses (active and inactive) in the summary view based on the filters and permissions applied. If a user interacts with the metrics, this number updates to reflect the courses in the view.

Figure: The Courses in View card indicating the number of active and inactive courses in the summary view.
 
The Average Grade card displays the average current grade or final grade for completed courses for the user across all the courses in the summary view. This number does not include predicted grade values in the average.

Figure: The Average Grade card on the summary view indicating the grade averaged from the courses in the view.
 
The Overdue Assignment card displays the number of assignments in the courses displayed in the summary view when the due date is past and there is no assignment submission or completion. You can click on the number in the Overdue Assignment card to filter the returned courses to those that have overdue assignments for the selected user.

Figure: The Overdue Assignments card on the summary view indicating the assignments that are currently overdue.

Figure: The Course Access Over Time chart tracks the learner's course accesses each week throughout the semester.
Using the Active and Inactive Courses view
At the bottom of the page, courses are grouped by active and inactive in this view to make it easier to understand which courses are currently in session. When you return to the overall page, any filters you previously applied are maintained.
An active course is one where:
The course start date is less than or equal to the current date and the course end date is greater than or equal to the current date.
The course start date is less than or equal to the current date and the course end date is null.
The course start date and end dates are both null and the Active flag is selected.
For users of Student Success System, the predicted grade appears on this view for active courses with a model.

Course Overview Widget

Set up the Course Overview widget
Note: The Course Overview widget is available to Brightspace Performance+ clients. To learn more about Brightspace Performance+, contact your D2L Client Sales Executive.
Ensure that the Brightspace platform and Brightspace Insights are enabled.
Grant Course Overview permissions to instructors.
From a course home page in Brightspace, click Edit this homepage in the bottom-right corner of the homepage.
In the Widgets section, click Add Widgets. Each panel has a corresponding Add Widgets button.
Select the check box beside the Course Overview widget and then click Add.
Click Save and Close.
Course Overview report types
Course Overview includes the following report types:
Course Access - use this report to better understand user engagement in a course.
Tool Access - use this report to better understand user engagement with course tools.
Total Logins - use this report to better understand activity in Brightspace.
Easily access analytics about learners and your course
To provide easier access to analytics about learners and courses, instructors can add the Course Overview widget to a course home page. The widget displays high-level aggregate information about the course and links to course-specific Brightspace Insights reports. For example, the widget can display a visualization of weekly course access (the Course Access report as a bar chart) and how many learners submitted quizzes today. In addition, the widget includes links to the Class Engagement tool, and Course Access and Tool Access reports.

Note: By default, the Course Overview widget does not appear in course home pages. The widget is also dependent on other D2L products and role permissions.
Brightspace Insights in the Course Overview widget
After you run a report, each report visualization type includes additional information and filters to help you understand and display the report data that is meaningful to you. You can also export the report data for further analysis in third party tools. 

Title:The report title displays the report type, for example, Total logins per day.If role filtering is enabled, a subtitle displays the roles included in the report, for example, Roles included: Admin (co), Administrator, AllSection, AllGroup and 15 more. Roles that appear on the report indicate that there is at least one user with that role in the org unit of the report you are viewing. You cannot filter out any of the roles that appear in the org unit.
Tooltips:Pausing on a chart element displays detailed information in a tooltip, for example, the date and number of login events. In a pie chart, the corresponding name in the summary table is also highlighted. Pausing on a name in the summary table for a pie chart displays a tooltip on the corresponding chart element.Pie graphs contain tooltips. For example, as you point to pie segments in the Total Logins report, a tooltip displays details about the segment such as the number of logins and date range. 
Sparkline:For a bar chart, the sparkline displayed below the chart provides context for the bar chart, for example, the number of logins for a longer date range than the bar chart displays. By clicking and dragging either edge of the display window of a sparkline, you can modify the date range for the report. This has the same effect as manually modifying the date range in the report control panel. By clicking and dragging the window, the display window can be shifted to earlier or later along the sparkline while maintaining the selected range of dates.
Summary:For a bar chart, a summary appears below the sparkline that displays the current date range and events, for example, the total number of logins the occurred in the last 7 daysFor a pie chart, tabular data appears below the chart for data transparency and accessibility. For example, the Tool Access report displays each tool, interactions as percentages, and the number of interactions. Clicking on a cell highlights the cell and column.For the Tool Access report, only the 10 most frequently used tools appear by name in the pie chart and summary. The remaining tools are grouped under Other. For the Tool Access report, any page that is configured in the software to generate a UserInteractionEvent counts as a page view. When a user browses from page to page within a tool, such as Discussions, Quizzes, or Content, each page counts as an additional event. The specified date range appears in the report title.
Filters:You can dynamically filter a report by date and role. For a pie chart, you can filter the report by Time span. For example, you can filter the Tool Access report by the last 7 days, 30 days, or 12 months. By default, the Tool Access report displays the last 7 days.For a bar chart, you can filter a report by Date range and Granularity. For example, you can filter the Total Logins report by the last 7 days, 12 months, or a custom date range. You can specify the granularity Per day or Per month.The Role filter allows you to filter report data by a specific role, multiple roles, or all roles. For example, you can see how many learners log in to Brightspace during a specific date range and what tools they interact with.By default, all roles display when you run a report.In the Rolefilter, roles are sorted alphabetically and are provided based on the roles list in the Roles and Permissions tool in Brightspace. You cannot customize which roles display in the Rolefilter.
Export options:Export to XLSX - Saves the report as an XLSX file to open in Microsoft® Excel®. In the XLSX file, the Dataset sheet displays the data used to generate the report and the Report sheet displays the report visualization.Export to CSV - Saves the report as a CSV (comma separated values) file so that it can be read by any text editor. You can also import the file to other tools or open it in Excel.When you export a report, the dataset only includes data that matches the current filters.
Troubleshooting Brightspace Insights within the Course
Filtering a report by date is designed to report on a specified date range; however, if the last 7 days in the date range do not contain data, the report displays data based on the earliest day containing data. For example, if you run a report on June 1, 2019 and the earliest date containing data is May 7, 2019, Brightspace Insights displays data from May 1, 2019 to May 7, 2019.

About Insights Report Builder

Important: In March 2024, D2L is introducing a new Insights Report Builder experience that leverages Amazon QuickSight as its visualization interface. In April 2024, authors' edit access to the old IRB will change to view-only access for a gradual transition.  For more information about this transition, refer to New Insights Report Builder Launch.
Insights Report Builder allows users to dig deeper into data and visualizations using skills and knowledge about Brightspace Data Sets (BDS) they already have, but without the complexity of having to work directly with a data warehouse. Users can launch Insights Report Builder directly from the Insights Portal to access report authoring or viewing based on their permissions.
By default, institutions receive two author licenses per org, but more licenses can be purchased if required.
Insights Report Builder gives you the following capabilities:
Start with a template visualization and customize it to be your own.
Create, edit, and share your reports, dashboards, and visualizations with other users.
Access fresh BDS data ready for visualizing.
Schedule reports and set alerts based on custom logic.
Power to leverage row level permissions.
Insights Report Builder leverages data from Brightspace and a third-party visualization engine powered by Domo.  Saved reports are automatically updated with refreshed DataFlows. Users can also tap into the Domo Community and resources to learn more about using the visualization engine.
 



--------------------------------------------------


Administering Insights Report Builder

Important: Brightspace Data Sets Major Version 8 is now the default version for Insights Report Builder. Authors must remap any DataFlows, reports, or dashboards that depend on Version 7 data sets to use Version 8 instead. For more details, refer to Updating Insights Report Builder for Brightspace Data Set Major Version 8 in Brightspace Community.
Insights Report Builder hosting requirements
The Brightspace Data Platform uses Amazon Web Services™ (AWS) for data storage. Data is hosted in the same region as your LMS.
Insights Report Builder permissions
Note: The Insights Report Builder is only intended for non-learner personas, and as such there is a maximum of 20,000 viewers. Ensure that only users who need access have the Can Use Insights Report Builder permission to keep your viewership below this limit.

Insights Report Builder roles
A unique, valid email address is required to create a new Insights Report Builder user. If multiple users share the same email address in Brightspace, then one of the users will be created successfully and the other will fail until a unique email address is defined.
When granting access to Insights Report Builder, it can take up to 1 hour for the new user to be added.
Author
By default, each organization has the ability to define 2 author users. Any user with an organization level role with the Can Use Insights Report Builder permission can become an author by being set up by an administrator with the Can Manage Insights Report Builder permission.   These authors do not need to have the same role.  Additional author licenses can be purchased.
To add, modify, or remove an author, go to the Insights Portal and click  Manage Authors. When you add a new author, they receive a notification in their navbar, and by email if that option was selected.

Authors can see all visualization templates, data sets, and DataFlow templates.  They can also see all the visualizations their fellow authors have built.  Visualizations in Insights Report Builder are called “cards” which can exist on “pages” or “dashboards”.
Authors are able to:
View their curated onboarding tutorial on the Quick Start for Authors dashboard.
View card templates  on the Templates dashboard.
View DataFlow  templates  in the Data tab with the Template tag.
View all data sets in the Data tab with the associated BDS version.
Create new DataFlows  with existing data sets.
Create groups in Admin Settings.
Add existing users to groups.
Create and modify cards.
Create scheduled reports and configure alerts.
Share cards, pages, and dashboards with users or groups.
Embed cards into other systems.
Export data to use offline.
View DomoStats Activity Log dashboard to understand the usage of Insights Report Builder for their organization.
Turn Magic ETL v2 on or off (it's on by default for new DataFlows).
Authors are not able to:
Edit or delete raw data sets.
Upload additional data sets.
Add new users via Insights Report Builder.  Users must be added through Roles and Permissions in Brightspace.
Viewer
Any user with an organization level role with the Can Use Insights Report Builder permission is automatically a viewer.  When launching Insights Report Builder, a viewer sees any reports, dashboards and visualizations that are explicitly shared with them as an individual or as a result of their presence in an Insights Report Builder defined group.
Viewers are able to:
View their curated onboarding tutorial on the Quick Start for Viewers dashboard.
Review cards and pages that have been shared with them.
Schedule reports and configure alerts to be emailed to users.
Interact with cards and pages that have been shared with them (filter, drill, export, etc).
Viewers are not able to:
Create cards or pages.
Access raw data sets or DataFlows.
Share visualizations with other users.
Trusted Attributes
To provide another layer of data access control, Authors can use Trusted Attributes to define data access for specific individuals. Trusted Attributes are a component of Personalized Data Permissions (PDP) policies that can be applied to DataFlows you create from existing data sets within Insights Report Builder. Once applied, these allow you to filter data for that DataFlow  to a specified set of users and groups.
Insights Report Builder supports the following Trusted Attributes:

Email


Brightspace User ID (appears in Insights Report Builder as Employee ID)


OrgRoleID (appears in Insights Report Builder as Department)

For instructions on how to create PDP policies, refer to Creating and Deleting PDP Policies on Domo Help Center.



--------------------------------------------------


Using Insights Report Builder

The core tasks you can perform using Insights Report Builder are as follows:
Create a visualization.
Add a filter.
Join DataFlows together using ETL or Blend.
Share a visualization.
Set up a scheduled report for emailing to a group of stakeholders.
Instructions to complete these tasks are included in the Quick Start for Authors dashboard embedded in the product.   
The data sets in Insights Report Builder contain the same data as what's available in Brightspace Data Sets from Data Hub.  For addition information on data sets, refer to About Data Hub.  Brightspace Data Sets run on a schedule that is either weekly fulls and daily diffs, or (for an additional cost) daily fulls and hourly diffs. Insights Report Builder checks every 4 hours to see if new data has been generated, and loads any new data into Domo. The data sets follow the same d2l.Tools.BrightspaceDataSets.Version configuration variable setting.  The version used is appended to the name of each data set.
Providing Feedback
Feedback can be provided in the Brightspace Community by submitting a PIE item.   All feedback is reviewed by the D2L product development team for consideration.
Troubleshooting Insights Report Builder
Email Address
A valid email address is required to create an Insights Report Builder user.  If more than one user shares the same email address in Brightspace, one of the users is created successfully but the other fails until a unique email address is defined. The check for unique email addresses is not case-sensitive.
Data Freshness
Since data is refreshed following the generation of Brightspace Data Set differentials, DataFlows are refreshed daily for most customers.  Authors can review when the data was refreshed by going to the Data tab  and reviewing the timestamp on each DataFlow.  Using out-of-date data in your analysis makes it more difficult to draw accurate conclusions.
User Management
When a user’s Insights Report Builder permissions are revoked, they are removed from Domo.  Additionally, if a user is downgraded from author to viewer or has permissions fully revoked, their assets (cards, pages, etc.) are shared with the other author(s) and d2lautomation and they become the new owners.  If no other author exists, the assets are shared with d2lautomation until a new author is added and receives said assets.

About LeaP

Brightspace LeaP is an adaptive learning tool that builds personalized learning paths for learners. When you enable connections to Brightspace LeaP from Brightspace, users can access Brightspace LeaP over a secure (HTTPS) connection. 
Brightspace LeaP creates learning paths based on course-specific, standard, or school-specific learning objectives. It uses content taken from the course to teach the objectives, and questions exported from the Question Bank to assess mastery of the objectives. It determines and recommends the most effective content per learning objective, guiding learners through content that adapts to their personal strengths and weaknesses as they interact with the tool. When the course content is copied into a new course shell, the learning path retains the information it has learned about effectively teaching the learners the concepts from the original course. 
Note: If you are intending to use D2L LOR content, learners must have appropriate trusts to the LORs so they can access information. Otherwise, the learners receive a Not Authorized message when the material appears in the learning path. Ensure that you verify the trust settings between the LORs and specific org units to which they are associated. If your learning objectives were created in an org unit above the course offering, ensure that the objectives are shared to the course offering so that LeaP can access them. 
What types of courses are best suited for LeaP?
LeaP is most appropriate for fact-based courses, such as geography, history, and science. It does not fully support formula-based (math, statistics) or language-based (creative writing, linguistics) subjects. 
The courses should have well-defined, granular learning objectives (which can be, but are not required to be entered in Brightspace). Course content should have the same granularity as the associated learning objectives, ideally, where each objective has more than one associated content item. 
The quizzes in courses intended for use with LeaP should have many quiz questions. 
Note: Courses used with LeaP must be taught in English, French, Spanish, or Brazilian Portuguese only. 
What are the main use cases for using LeaP in a course? 
LeaP generally performs best when it covers a chapter or a week's worth of material. This results in learning paths that are long enough to be effective, but not so long as to overwhelm learners with information. With that consideration, there are three main use cases for LeaP: flipped content, chapter review, and full adaptive learning.
Flipped Content
In the Flipped Content use case, the Leap path is the first link in a module's content. In this scenario, most of the learner's progress takes place through the learning path; however, the chapter's content remains available in case the learner wants to manually visit a specific topic. In this case, it may be appropriate to use the following settings:
Diagnostic Test = No. Starting a chapter with a test may be intimidating to learners.
Number of Questions per Learning Objective = 3. This means learners have mastered a concept when they achieve three correct questions for the learning objective. The value set in this field dictates how many questions appear on the LeaP pre-test and post-test, using the formula: Number of learning objectives multiplied by the number of questions per learning objective. 
Chapter review
In the Chapter review use case, the learning path is the last link in the module's content. In this use case, LeaP enables learners to review the material in the traditional manner and study (remediate) any weak areas of knowledge before taking the end-of-chapter test. This use case is beneficial when learners are expected to read each page of the content. In this case, it may be appropriate to use the following settings:
Diagnostic Test = Yes. You can test learners on what they learned from the chapter and are then presented with the material they need to fill in the gaps in their knowledge. 
Hide mastered content = Yes. When learners have mastered the learning objectives in the path, no further content appears and a message that indicates their mastery is displayed.
Number of Questions per Learning Objective = 3. This means learners have mastered a concept when they achieve three correct questions for the learning objective. The value set in this field dictates how many questions appear on the LeaP pre-test and post-test, using the formula Number of learning objectives multiplied by the number of questions per learning objective. 
Full Adaptive Learning
In the Full Adaptive Learning use case, all the content in the module is replaced with a LeaP path. In this path, the material is only available to learners using the learning path. The content remains within the module, but it is hidden from learners. 
How can I see my learning path from a learner's point of view?
There are three methods:
Press the Go to Preview button. This method provides a quick way to view the learning path without submitting test results to the Grade book.
Enroll a test learner in the course. This method provides the added benefit of sending test results to the Grade book. However, the LeaP algorithm starts learning which pages are more or less effective based on the test learner's results, which may skew the path for real learners.
Copy the course to a new course offering and enroll a test learner. This method requires administrative overhead to create the course, copy the contents into it, and enroll a test learner. Manual path alignments made in the original course do not transfer to the new course after the copy; rather, they must be replicated in the new course offering. However, this method provides the most comprehensive way of seeing the learner experience without affecting LeaP's adaptive learning for the actual course. 
Gatekeeping content using LeaP
LeaP does not have a true gating mechanism to ensure that learners master the concepts presented by the learning path before moving on to the next chapter. However, if you are sending the LeaP test results to the Grade book, you can apply release conditions on subsequent chapters of information. In this way, the learner must achieve the prescribed threshold on the LeaP grade item before the they can see the next chapter. 
Using LeaP with assistive technology
LeaP has been fully tested with the NVDA and some testing has been done with JAWS. 
 



--------------------------------------------------


LeaP Input: Learning Objectives

When you create your learning path, LeaP does not impose a limit on the number of learning objectives; however, best results are often achieved when a path contains 5-10 learning objectives. In general, 5 to 10 learning objectives, plus the associated content and questions, results in a learning path that is long enough to be instructional, but no so long as to be overwhelming to the learner. 
Using learning objectives that apply to multiple chapters
In some cases, you may have a common set of learning objectives that apply to multiple chapters. If you include the same learning objective across multiple LeaP paths, it may result in an awkward learning experience since LeaP offers the same content and questions in each path for the same learning objective. The learner sees and is quizzed on the same information several times. Some alternatives to this scenario include:
Create a single learning path for common objectives as an introductory module. Then, you can exclude that content from each chapter's learning path.
Refine or split the learning objectives so that each path contains specific, but unique, sub-components of the original objectives.
Why can't I change the learning objectives in LeaP?
Learning objectives are the foundation of a LeaP path because they form the basis of what the student is expected to learn. Changing the learning objectives once the path has been created is inadvisable; even more so once the path has learned which content is most effective in teaching the fundamentals of a learning objective. If you change the learning objectives, it implies that a whole new learning path should also be created. 
I need to pull the learning objectives from a course. What fields does LeaP look at? 
LeaP accesses the Name and Description fields for learning objectives. 
What information is in the CSV import file?
The TID (Topic ID) is a unique identifier for each row. 
The ParentID allows you to build a hierarchy of folders for your learning objectives which is only visible in the wizard. The wizard helps you  select learning objectives for a path. The Parent ID field is a foreign key to the TID field. 
The Leaf value indicates the learning objectives in the file (as opposed to the rows that appear only to provide hierarchy for organizing your learning objectives). The LeaP wizard displays the rows where Leaf = Y as the learning objectives available to be included in the path.
 



--------------------------------------------------


LeaP Input: Content

At a minimum, each learning objective in your learning path should have 2-3 content pages. The more content you can associate with a learning objective, the better able learners are to master the objective. LeaP accesses content provided in the Content tool and supports the following content types:
Content Type
What LeaP does to the content
Text-based files including PDF, Microsoft Office Suite files including Word and PowerPoint.
LeaP analyzes the plain-text representation of the document (including the presenter notes for PowerPoint). No special handling is required.
Videos, images, and sound
LeaP cannot parse text from video, images, or sound files; only the file name can be parsed by LeaP. Embed the video/image/sound file into an HTML page containing a textual description to provide LeaP with additional context.
Websites that prevent rendering in iFrames

LeaP cannot display the content in the Brightspace LMS iFrame; rather, you can open the LeaP path as an external resource.
Alternatively, you can create a web page in your course and include a link to the website on the page.
Note: Include context information on the course web page that LeaP can use for its semantic matching. 

Brightspace LOR
LeaP can display LOR content if the learner has appropriate permissions and trusts to access the LOR material. When building the path, LeaP parses the LOR object's title, keywords, and description metadata fields.
Dynamic web content (such as JavaScript)
LeaP cannot analyze the content, but it can be displayed.
SCORM packages
SCORM packages are essentially the opposite of LeaP because SCORM requires learner consume the material in a prescribed sequence. LeaP, rather, builds adaptive and personalized learning paths for students. 
Note: Files that are saved in the Manage Files repository but are not linked into existing Content are not accessible to LeaP.
I've added new content, but it does not appear in the LeaP path. How can I get LeaP to use the new material?
Every day, LeaP automatically looks for and adds new content, but it doesn't automatically recalculate learning paths when new content is added. It can take up to 24 hours for the new content to appear in the learning paths. To manually force LeaP to recalculate a path, administrators or instructors can create a new LeaP path anywhere in the course offering. When you create the new LeaP path, it forces all paths in the offering to recalculate, and you can then see the new content displayed. Once you verify the content is visible, you can delete the newly created path. 
Using relevance weighting on content
The single, highest-rated piece of content is shown for a learning objective. The remainder of the content appears as Recommended Reading.
Removing unwanted content from a learning path
You can remove content from a learning path in two ways: 
If you need to remove the content from the specific learning objective, use the Content Alignment tool. Select the learning objective and set the content item value to 0%.
If you need to completely remove the content from learning path, including learning objectives and search results, in the course, browse to Edit Learning Path > Content Repositories > This Course. Find the content you want to remove from the learning path from the list of all content in the course, then click the Visible toggle to hide the content. 
If you delete pages from the course offering, you may encounter a Page Not Found error in the learning path. Deleted content is not auto-detected by LeaP; it may be preferable to manually hide the content to avoid the error. Learners may also encounter Page Not Found errors if the learners do not have the same permissions to view pieces of content that the instructor can access. To troubleshoot this error message: 
Ensure that the content is published (rather than being in a draft or unpublished state)
Ensure that the content is from the D2L LOR
Verify that the learners have proper trusts to view the content.
Including hidden text for LeaP's semantic matching
You may want to include hidden text in your content that is not visible to learners, but is available for LeaP's semantic matching. To achieve this, use the HTML style attribute in the following format:
<p style=”display:none;”>This is hidden content.</p>
How can LeaP use external web pages (including videos)
There are 4 possible ways to submit external web pages and videos to LeaP:
Embed the URL into the HTML course content pages
You can explicitly set the metadata LeaP uses for the pages by including it in the HTML page content (optionally hiding it using the style=”display:none;” attribute).
You can change this metadata at any time, although you’ll need to recreate the learning path for the new metadata to be read by LeaP.
LeaP does not crawl the external web page for metadata.
For videos, the learner sees a thumbnail of the video in the page.
For example: 
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRKxmXwLvUU" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="display: none;">Average Velocity: Students will understand that average velocity is displacement divided by time.</p>
Include the URL links in the course content
LeaP crawls the external web page for metadata.
You cannot specify additional or replacement metadata for LeaP to use for the page.
Submit URLs to LeaP in the wizard interface > Content Repositories > User Contributed Content
LeaP crawls the external web page for metadata.
You cannot specify additional or replacement metadata for LeaP to use for the page.
Submit URLs to LeaP using a CSV file
You can specify the metadata or allow LeaP to crawl the external web page for metadata
If you specify the metadata, you cannot subsequently view or modify that metadata., To use new metadata, you must hide the original URL, slightly change the URL (for example, by adding a question mark to the end of the URL), and then re-upload the URL with new metadata.
The window displaying LeaP content is too small. Is there a way to break it out of the content frame? 
You can open the learning path as an external resource to display the content in a new browser window. In the Path Properties dialog, click the Open as External Resource check box. 
Why do I sometimes see 2 learning paths for a single objective in the Content Alignment tab?
LeaP is intended to show a single piece of content for each learning objective in a path. This means that if a single piece of content is the best match for two or more learning objectives, then LeaP needs to display the best AND second best (and possibly additional best) matches in the path in order to preserve the cardinality of the number of learning objectives to the number of content items. In the Content Alignment tab, this manifests as multiple learning paths for an objective. 
How does LeaP determine the level of mastery for a set of learning objectives. Can the faculty change this level?
LeaP considers a concept to be mastered when the learner correctly answers the number of test questions defined by the Number of Questions per Learning Objective value in the wizard. You can change the Number of Questions per Learning Objective value in the LeaP path settings.
 



--------------------------------------------------


LeaP Input: Questions

It is important to provide enough questions that LeaP can draw upon for each learning objective. LeaP offers 3 questions to the learner each time they are tested on a particular learning objective, so if there aren't enough questions, the learner sees the same question repeatedly. Generally, having 10-15 questions for each learning objective provides a good selection to assess the learning objective. 
What type of questions are best suited for LeaP?
Questions near the bottom of Bloom's Taxonomy (knowledge, comprehension) are easier for LeaP to analyze. Because they typically share the same keywords as the learning objectives, the semantic matching algorithm can select appropriate questions for the given learning path. 
Questions near the top of Bloom's Taxonomy (evaluation, synthesis, analysis) are more challenging for LeaP to use because the appropriate answers may be too subjective for semantic analysis. 
LeaP works best with multiple-choice and true/false questions. It is not possible to use multi-select questions with LeaP. 
Note: LeaP does not support randomizing answer choices. 
What is relevance weighting on questions?
All questions with a higher relevance than the slider threshold can randomly appear on LeaP tests. A question's relevance rating, combined with its relevance to a specific piece of content (which is not displayed in the LeaP interface) determines if the question randomly appears in the Practice section. If you set the question slider too high, the Practice question section may be empty since the combined relevance of the questions to the learning objective and the content may not exceed the threshold value. 
What file formats can I use to upload questions?
You can upload questions in two ways:
Upload questions into LeaP using a QTI package (for example, exported from Brightspace or Respondus) or using a CSV. 
Pull questions from the Quizzes tool or the Question Library directly into LeaP.
Note: D2L strongly recommends that all questions appear natively in the Question Library of a LeaP course and are drawn from that source instead of a CSV import. 
My images are too wide for the Practice Question sidebar. What can I do?
Reduce the width of each image to display at 280 pixels so that the full image is visible in the Practice interface. For images where students need a larger view, add HTML code to open the image full size in a new browser tab. 
When does LeaP show question feedback?
LeaP shows feedback immediately when a learner submits a question response. The same feedback appears whether the response is correct or incorrect.
I want to modify a question in my LeaP path
For questions that you have added to LeaP directly from the Quizzes tool or Question Library, you can make changes using the LeaP wizard. Alternatively, you can edit the question in the Quiz interface; however, you'll need to create a new LeaP path to force LeaP to pick up the modification.
D2L does not recommend that you modify the question in the CVS or QTI file and re-upload into LeaP. If you do, you must do one of the following extra steps: 
In the  LeaP Wizard Content Alignment tab, set the relevance of the old question to 0%.
In the LeaP Wizard Questions tab, mark the old question as Hidden. 
I want to remove a question from my LeaP path
Do one of the following: 
In the  LeaP Wizard Content Alignment tab, set the relevance of the question you want to remove to 0%.
In the LeaP Wizard Questions tab, mark the removed question as Hidden. 
If I send the results of a Leap path quiz to Grades, which attempt does it record?
LeaP records the learner's most recent attempt in the Grade book and permits the learner an unlimited number of attempts. 
My learning path for a module appears to be pulling questions from a different module
It is not possible for you to organize questions for modules within LeaP. All questions go into a single LeaP question pool for the course. LeaP then runs algorithms against the question pool and aligns the questions to the learning objectives specified for the path. In this way, algorithms may pull questions from a different module if the questions are a good match for the learning objectives you have specified. 
You can review the alignments for each path in the Content Alignment tab and make manual adjustments.

About Student Success System

Student Success System (S3) is a tool that helps to drive learner retention by using predictive analytics and machine learning techniques to give instructors advanced knowledge of both learners who are struggling and those who may need additional challenges to keep them engaged. It can make predictions about the final grade for each student uses supporting visualizations and dashboards to identify learners who may need more from their instructors.
Note: Student Success System is available to Performance+ clients. To learn more about Performance+, contact your D2L Client Sales Executive.
How does Student Success System work?
Before you can use Student Success System, administrators must first do the following:
Add target courses to the system to generate predictions of learner success, using historical courses for comparison. (Historical courses are prior offerings of the target courses that are representative of the courses in terms of teaching and learning expectations.) 
Create and configure predictive models for target courses in the administrative Brightspace Student Success System interface.
Once Student Success System is set up and configured, you can use it to monitor predictions of learner success levels for active and enabled courses on a weekly basis in five possible domains: course access, content access, social learning, assessments, and preparedness. The weekly predictions produce a success index for every learner in the course, letting you visualize and compare potential success rates.
All learners in the course display in a list on a class dashboard, as well as on their own personal dashboard that displays data on their performance in the course. A win-loss chart provides an at-a-glance visualization of a learner's performance in comparison to the rest of the class in all the pre-selected domains. Detailed and interactive visualizations are available for the success index, social learning domain, and assessments domain.



--------------------------------------------------


Set up Student Success System

Add administrative access to Student Success System
Note the following:
The See Student SIS Data permission corresponds to the Preparedness domain. The Preparedness domain was part of a D2L beta program that is now closed; it is not a valid domain to include in predictive models.
The administrator must be enrolled in the course offerings for any target course they want to run predictive models for.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Roles and Permissions.
Click the role you want to be responsible for managing Brightspace Student Success System, for example, Administrator.
From the Filter by Tool drop-down list, select Student Success System and then click Apply Filter.
Select Manage Courses and Predictive Models at the Organization level and Access Student Success System at the Course Offering level.
Click Save and Close.
Add instructor access to Student Success System
From the Admin Tools menu, click Roles and Permissions.
Click on the role you want to be responsible for accessing Brightspace Student Success System-enabled courses, for example Instructor.
From the Filter by Tool drop-down list, select Student Success System, and then click Apply Filter.

Manage Student Success System

Administrators are responsible for provisioning Brightspace Student Success System by: 
Managing target courses
Building predictive models
Monitoring active courses
Add a target course
From the Admin Tools menu, click Student Success System.
Click Add Course.
	Select the course you want to add.
Click Add.
Configure a predictive model
Once you add a target course, you can configure a predictive model for it. While the model is being built, the progress status displays as "Building [ ]% complete." Click Refresh to refresh the building status or Cancel to cancel it. Once the build completes, the model status displays as "Ready" and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) displays. The MSE is also visible on the Review Model page for the predictive model.
MSE is calculated as the average deviations between the estimated grades used in calculating the success index and actual grades. The average is calculated over all weeks and all data domains. The value is then normalized to a percentage value. The smaller the MSE, the more accurate the predictive model is thought to be.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Student Success System.
From the context menu of the target course you want to configure, click Configure Model.
Select the domains you want to include in the model.  To eliminate irrelevant measurements from the model, D2L recommends  excluding domains that have no corresponding data in the system.Note: The Preparedness domain was part of a D2L beta program that is now closed; it is not a valid domain to include in predictive models.
In the Advanced Model Options section (click the arrow to expand), select the Model Aggregation Type and Data Extraction preferences. Note: The system selects the Domain Aggregation and Cumulative Weeks options by default. D2L recommends leaving the default selections in place.
Confirm or modify the grade ranges for the three risk categories. You can set default values by modifying the d2l.Tools.S3.GradeRangePotentialRiskValue and d2l.Tools.S3.GradeRangeSuccessfulValue configuration variables.
If start and end dates are not automatically included, enter a Start Date and End Date for the course.
 To define which roles to include in the predictive model, click the Edit icon.
In the Map Historic Courses section, click Add Course to add at least one historic course to the predictive model.Note: The more consistent the historic courses are with the target course you are configuring, the more accurate you can expect the predictions to be. Any historic course you add must contain enrolled participants.
Click Save and Continue. If a course does not meet the requirements for use as a historic course in the predictive model, an   Error icon displays in the Status column for the course. Clicking the icon provides an explanation of why the course failed.
On the Review page, click Build Model.
Once you create a predictive model for a course, it is stored in the Insights database and generates daily predictions as part of the ETL (extract, transform, load) process.
Copy a predictive model
You can reuse the existing model configuration of a historical course.
Important: Copying a configuration overwrites the current configuration of that course.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Student Success System.
From the context menu of the target course you want to copy a predictive model from, click Review Model.
Click Update Model.
Click Copy Model Configuration.
Choose a course.
Optionally, choose to Include the selected course as an additional historical course.
Click Copy.
Click Save and Continue.
Update a predictive model
You can update a predictive model at any time, including once a course commences. Every time you update a model, the system builds an additional model for the course. You can use the Revision Log to switch between the various models for a course. Use this functionality to apply simulations to a previous offering of the course so that you can test and validate the model configuration before applying it to an upcoming offering of the course.

Students at Risk widget

To enhance monitoring of learner success, instructors can add a new Students at Risk widget to a course homepage in Brightspace. Once a week, Brightspace Student Success System updates the widget to display up to 5 students that the system determines are "at risk." The sub-title of the widget reflects the predicted grades for the week.
Set up the Students at Risk widget
By default, the Students at Risk widget does not appear in course home pages.
Ensure that Brightspace Student Success System is enabled.
From your course homepage, click Edit this Homepage in the bottom-right corner of the homepage.

Figure: The Edit this Homepage option on a course homepage.
In the Widgets section, click Add Widgets. Each panel has a corresponding Add Widgets button.

Figure: The Add Widgets options in the Widgets section.
Select the check box beside the Students at Risk widget and then click Add.
Click Save and Close.
Using the Students at Risk widget
After you add the Students at Risk widget to a course home page, you can begin using the widget to monitor learner success.
By default, learner names display as Anonymous in the widget. This allows instructors to protect learner names in situations when the instructor displays the course home page to other learners, for example, in a classroom or during a web cast. Next to each learner name, a predicted grade for the week displays.
To view learner information for a single learner, point to the widget or move the input focus (for accessibility) to the anonymous name. To view the photos and names of all learners listed in the widget, click the Show names link.
To display more detailed information about that learner's predicted outcome, click on a learner's name to load the dashboard page for that learner. 
To display all learners in the course and the success index, click View all predicted grades to load the standard D2L Student Success System page.

About parent/guardian-child user relationships

Your institution is responsible for maintaining the accuracy of user relationships in your Student Information System (SIS). Consult with your advisers to ensure you adhere to your institution’s privacy and security policies, and applicable laws. For example, your institution or jurisdiction might have a policy or law that specifies when a child turns 18, the parent or legal guardian should no longer have access to their child's content, unless the child consents to granting access; this case needs to be handled while generating and sending parent/guardian-child relationships to Brightspace.



--------------------------------------------------


Using Holding Tank with Brightspace Parent & Guardian

For detailed information on using Holding Tank, refer to the Holding Tank - Administrator guide.
Similar to creating learner and instructor users, create parent/guardian users with Holding Tank.Make sure you have a strategy to uniquely define OrgDefinedIds for parents/guardians in Brightspace.
Create user-relationship.xml and user-relationship.alldone.A user relationship is between a parent/guardian and child. This relationship is sent to Brightspace using the Holding Tank Batch process.A user relationship file is a mapping of the parent/guardian OrgDefinedId and child OrgDefinedId. The file must be generated and uploaded to the existing Holding Tank SFTP location by the school or school board. The file name should end with user-relationship.xml.Like other batch processes, you must include an ALLDONE file for each XML file in the processing directory. This ALLDONE file shares its file name with the XML file. The ALLDONE file informs the SISImport process when the XML file is complete and ready for processing.User relationship files should contain a snapshot of all relationships; it is not a diff (incremental update).
Map the parent/guardian role.From the Admin Tools menu, click SIS Integration – Course Mappings. Under Integration, select Roles to map the parent/guardian role you created with the same role name entered as role code.
Confirm that the parent/guardian-child relationship is created.For more information, see Viewing parent/guardian-child relationships.
Note: The user-relationship.xml file is processed with other Holding Tank Batch process files at the scheduled time for your school or school board. To find out when the Holding Tank job runs, contact your D2L Support representative.
Holding Tank troubleshooting steps for D2L Support
To triage Holding Tank issues, confirm the following:
The Holding Tank UI is configured for the school or school board.
 In Holding Tank batch configuration, <onlyuserswithenrollments> is set to false  to allow the parent/guardian user to be enrolled  at the org level.
parentPortalImport command is set up.
The school mapped the parent/guardian role.
The school created parent/guardian users using Holding Tank.
The school uploaded user-relationship files and the orgdefinedIds for parents/guardians and students exist in Brightspace.




--------------------------------------------------


XSD Schema

You can use this XSD schema to validate the user-relationship file.<?xml version="1.0"?><xs:schema attributeFormDefault="unqualified" elementFormDefault="qualified" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"> <xs:element name="Relationships">  <xs:complexType>   <xs:sequence>    <xs:element name="Parent-Child" maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0">     <xs:complexType>      <xs:all>       <xs:element type="id" name="ChildId" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" />       <xs:element type="id" name="ParentId" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" />      </xs:all>     </xs:complexType>    </xs:element>   </xs:sequence>  </xs:complexType> </xs:element><xs:simpleType name="id"> <xs:restriction base="xs:string">  <xs:maxLength value="50" /> </xs:restriction></xs:simpleType></xs:schema>

--------------------------------------------------


Use IPSIS LIS 2.0 Integration with Brightspace Parent & Guardian

Make sure you have a strategy to uniquely define sourceId for parents/guardians in Brightspace, as user-relationship is a mapping of unique sourceId between parents/guardians and children. When you send replacePerson requests to create users, ensure that you send parent/guardian sourceId information in the agent section of the request for children/learners. This creates the relationship between parent/guardian and child. 
Five new plug-ins have been added to the IPSIS LIS 2.0 Adapter, which help create, update, and delete Parent/Guardian-Child relationship. Plug-ins are automatically set up:
IReplaceUserHandler Interface ParentPortalUpdateRelationshipHandler
IDeleteUserHandler Interface ParentPortalDeleteRelationshipHandler
IDeleteUserHandler Interface DeleteUserRemoveRelationshipsHandler
ITranslatePerson Interface PersonRequestAgentsTranslator
ITranslateReadPersonResponse Interface ReadUserAgentsTranslator
ParentPortalCreateRelationshipHandler
ParentPortalUpdateRelationshipHandler implicitly creates and updates relationships between parents/guardians and learners (children).
Implementation:
D2L.Integration.ParentPortal.IPSIS.RequestAdapters.ParentPortalUpdateRelationshipHandler,D2L.Integration.ParentPortal.IPSIS
Expected behavior:
The handler performs the following tasks:
•	Implicitly creates and updates parent/guardian-child relationships as defined by the agent field for a learner on a replace user request.
•	Synchronizes relationships for user if SynchronizeRelationships extension field is provided. Learner is kept in the system but all relationships are removed.
Error behavior:
If there is a problem during processing, an exception is thrown, along with as much detailed information as possible.
Configuration note:
•	This should be placed after all the Replace handlers.
DeleteUserRemoveRelationshipsHandler
DeleteUserRemoveRelationshipsHandler is used to remove the agent relationship when the user is deleted.
Implementation
D2L.IM.IPSIS.Default.Users.Handlers.DeleteUserRemoveRelationshipsHandler,D2L.IM.IPSIS.Default
Expected Behavior:
When a parent/guardian or child is deleted, the relationship is deleted.
Configuration note:
This should be placed after ParentPortalDeleteRelationshipHandler
ParentPortalDeleteRelationshipHandler
ParentPortalDeleteRelationshipHandler implicitly deletes relationships between parents/guardians and learners (children) (ie. when a relationship is missing, Brightspace will delete the relationship).
Implementation
D2L.Integration.ParentPortal.IPSIS.RequestAdapters.ParentPortalDeleteRelationshipHandler,D2L.Integration.ParentPortal.IPSIS
Expected behavior:
The handler performs the following tasks:
•	Deletes parent/guardian-child relationships
Error behavior:
If there is a problem during processing, an exception is thrown, along with as much detailed information as possible.
Configuration note:
•	This should be placed before all the Delete handlers.
PersonRequestAgentsTranslator
PersonRequestAgentsTranslator is required to map the agent identifier.
Implementation
D2L.IM.IPSIS.LIS.RequestAdapters.PMS.Default.PersonRequestAgentsTranslator,D2L.IM.IPSIS.LIS
Expected Behavior:
Maps agents from the request and creates parent/guardian relationships.
Configuration note:
This should be placed at the end of the translators.
ReadUserAgentsTranslator
ReadUserAgentsTranslator is used to retrieve parents and guardians associated with the user.
Implementation:
D2L.IM.IPSIS.LIS.ResultAdapters.PMS.Default.ReadUserAgentsTranslator,D2L.IM.IPSIS.LIS
Configuration note:
This should be placed at the end of the translators.

Use IPSIS OneRoster with Brightspace Parent & Guardian

IPSIS OneRoster can send user relationships between a parent/legal guardian and child to Brightspace. Brightspace Parent & Guardian IPSIS OneRoster integration is only available to clients in the US, Canada, Australia, and Ireland.
Currently only the following roles are considered relevant for relationship:
Parent
Guardian
Student
All other roles will be ignored.
Steps to set up OneRoster
On the IPSIS Administration page, open the Configuration tab.
If you have a OneRoster 1.1 - CSV source system, the SFTP credentials are displayed. Copy the host, username, and password (these are needed by your SIS to send CSV files to Brightspace).
If you have a OneRoster 1.1 – REST, source system, you must select the OAuth method.OAuth1.0a is selected by default. Enter the valid endpoint URL, consumer key, consumer secret, and select the OAuth Signature Method.If OAuth2 is selected, enter the valid Client Id and Client Secret.
Map the SIS Parent or Guardian role to your Brightspace role for parents/guardians.
 Map the SIS Learner role to your Brightspace role for learners. 
Map the SIS Org School to a Brightspace Org Unit Type.
Review other settings and click Save.

Viewing parent/guardian-child relationships

Only authorized users with the role permission See Parent/Guardian Child Relationships for '{RoleName}' can see parent/guardian-child relationships.
From the Admin Tools menu, select Users.
Search for a user and click on their name to view user details.
Select the Relationships tab to view a list of related users.




--------------------------------------------------


Use D2L Standard CSV with Brightspace Parent & Guardian

Create parent/guardian users and relationships between the learner and the parent/guardian using D2L Standard CSV Users (Version 1.1 – including relationship) CSV file format.



--------------------------------------------------


Notifications for upcoming due dates

To notify parents and guardians about their child's upcoming work, you can enable the visibility of the Update alerts icon in the Brightspace Parent & Guardian web application. When visible, this icon indicates there are notifications for upcoming assignments and quizzes that are due in the next 2 days.
Note: This functionality only impacts the web application. Turning the configuration variable on or off does not affect notifications in the Brightspace Parent & Guardian app.
When parents and guardians log in to the Brightspace Parent & Guardian web application, the learner selector page displays the Update alerts icon, indicating there are upcoming assignments or quizzes for one or more learners.
Parents and guardians click the Update alerts icon, and then one of the notifications from the list. This navigates to that learner's dashboard, where the upcoming assignment or quiz is visible in the Work To Do widget.
To enable notifications in the Brightspace Parent & Guardian web application
To enable visibility of the icon in the Brightspace Parent & Guardian web application, turn on the d2l.Tools.ParentPortal.Nav.ShowNotifications configuration variable. The default value is off.            
                Ensure that parents and guardians are enrolled in the org as a Parent/Guardian role; enrollment in the child’s courses are not required.




--------------------------------------------------


Weekly activity summaries for parents and guardians

Parents and guardians can choose to receive a weekly summary of their child's activity in Brightspace. Each Saturday at 8 AM (based on the server time in the client's specific AWS region), an activity summary is emailed to parents and guardians that contains notifications and reminders. For example, an activity summary may contain reminders when assignments are due and notifications when an instructor shares portfolio items. 
Note: Parents and guardians receive one email per child.
Configuration variable
By default, this functionality is turned on in Brightspace; however, it can be turned off by editing the d2l.Tools.ParentPortal.Notifications.DigestEnabled configuration variable. 
If the configuration variable is turned on, parents and guardians then log in to Brightspace Parent & Guardian, enter and verify their email address, and select the option for emailing an activity summary.
Role permission
To enhance the security of custom email addresses in Brightspace, all new users setting up a custom email address must verify the email address (by clicking a link in a verification email) before they receive notifications from Brightspace.
To receive weekly activity summaries in Brightspace Parent & Guardian, new parent/guardian roles must have the following  permissions at the organization level:

Set custom email notification


Change My Email Address

Note the following:
If an administrator disables the new permission for an existing role, the user must subscribe to notifications again to receive them.
If an existing parent/guardian user changes their email address, they must verify their custom email address prior to receiving weekly email notifications.




--------------------------------------------------


Tools associated with Brightspace Parent & Guardian

The following tools are integrated with Brightspace Parent & Guardian:
Brightspace Portfolio - Parents and guardians can see Portfolio items shared by instructors.
Activity Feed - Parents and guardians can view an aggregate activity feed from all courses their child is enrolled in. Parents and guardians can read posts, access links in posts, however they cannot access content files.
Assignments - Parents and guardians can see any assignments that have a due date, or end date in the Upcoming work widget. If the due date on an assignment is past, and the learner has not made a submission, then an overdue online assignment alert message is displayed to the parent. Parent/guardian users are authorized to access any licensed content attached to assignments.
Quizzes - Parents and guardians can see any quizzes that have a due date, or end date in the Upcoming work widget. If the due date on a quiz is past, and the learner has not made a submission, then an overdue online quiz alert message is displayed to the parent or guardian.
Grades - Parents and guardians can see released grade items and final grades. This widget is only visible to parents and guardians if a learner's courses are using the grade book, and the learner has the permission to See the grades tool.
Email - Instructors can email parents and guardians from the Classlist tool. This requires send-only email functionality; full email functionality is not required.

Brightspace Parent & Guardian FAQs

How can we handle cases where a Teacher is also a parent or guardian at the school board?
D2L expects Teachers who are also parents or guardians to have separate userids/account from their Teacher account. At this time, we do not support a single account as the user experience would be compromised if they shared the same account.
Are parents and guardians able to see everything within the context of the entire school year?
Yes. If the child is enrolled in the course, the parent or guardian can see class activity feed, and upcoming online assignments and quizzes for the entire school year.
Can schools control what parents and guardians see on the Brightspace Parent & Guardian page with permissions?
Yes and no.
Assignments with a due date or end date, and quizzes with an end date are automatically shared with parents and guardians in the Upcoming Work widget.
Classroom activity feed posts are automatically shared with parents and guardians. Parents and guardians are not able to see any comments left by learners.
Teachers can choose the Portfolio items that are shared with parents and guardians.
Content files attached to assignments are automatically shared with parents and guardians.
Can I enable just the web application or just the mobile app? Can I disable the mobile app?
No. If Brightspace Parent & Guardian is enabled in your school, both the web application and mobile app are enabled and parents/guardians with an account can sign in to both.

Manage Local Repositories

Brightspace Learning Repository is an online library for storing, managing, and sharing your learning resources (learning objects). A learning object can be a quiz, a presentation, an image, a video, or any other kind of document or file you use to create course content and learning materials for online learning.
When you publish your learning objects to Learning Repository, you tag those objects with metadata to classify and organize your learning objects and make them easily searchable for others. You can classify learning objects according to defined learning standards or goals. You can also review, rate, and provide feedback on learning objects to ensure high quality online resources.
Types of properties for a local repository
You can modify the following properties for a local repository:
Name - This is a required field and cannot contain any apostrophes, but can be Unicode.
Description - This can be Unicode.
Search by Default - This selects the check box for Brightspace Learning Repository in the list of local repositories on the Search and Advanced Local Search pages.
Public Access - This makes the repository available to users who do not have Brightspace login credentials.
Status - All learning objects published to the repository are automatically classified as Unassigned, Approved, Archived, Draft, or In Review.
Visibility - Make learning objects published to the repository visible or hidden in search results.
Public Availability - Make learning objects published to the repository publicly available and shareable for users without login credentials, or make learning objects unavailable to external users.

About deleting a repository

Deleting a repository flags it as deleted in the database, but does not delete that repository immediately. A background process is run to delete all objects in the repository and then the repository is permanently deleted if all objects are successfully deleted including properties, trusts and trust permissions. 
Deletion means:
The repository is considered deleted in the current organization and any other organization that has access to it.
Users can no longer search the deleted repository.
Learning objects or files contained in a deleted repository are not returned in searches.
Links created to learning objects or files in that repository, including locked links to previous versions, cease to work.
Delete a repository
On the navbar, click LOR. 
From the tool navigation, click Manage.
Do one of the following:On the Manage page, click the Delete icon in the Learning Object Repositories table for a specific repository.On an Brightspace Learning Repository's landing page, from the More Actions button, click Delete .




--------------------------------------------------


Associate trusts with a repository

On the navbar, click LOR.
From the tool navigation, click Manage.
In the Learning Object Repositories table, click the Manage Trusts icon for the repository.
Click Create a New Trust.
To find the org unit to set up a trust for, on the Create Trust: Org Unit page, click Search.
Select the org unit that you want your new LOR to trust and click Continue. 
To create trust permissions for your Brightspace Learning Repository, click Use Role Permissions or Create Custom Permissions. Using role permissions creates trust permissions for all roles and all Brightspace Learning Repository permissions. This means Learning Repository yields control of access decisions to the Brightspace (through Roles and Permission). Choosing trust permissions enables you to specify which Brightspace roles in the trusted org unit the LOR trusts.




--------------------------------------------------


Modify trust permissions settings

Permissions set for Brightspace Learning Repository need to match those for Brightspace for the trust to work.
On the navbar, click LOR.
From the tool navigation, click Manage.
In the Learning Object Repositories table, click the Manage Trusts icon for the repository.
On the Manage Trusts page, click the Edit icon for the trusted org unit.  
On the Edit Trust Permissions page, select new trust permissions or clear existing trust permissions using the check boxes corresponding to the roles and permissions. 
Use the column, row, and grid Select All check boxes to select or clear multiple check boxes.
Click Save Permissions.
You cannot save a trust with no trust permissions. If you want to delete the entire trust, on the Manage Trusts page, use the Delete icon of the trust. When you delete trusts they are completely deleted. They cannot be undeleted or retrieved. You must create the trust again.



--------------------------------------------------


Set metadata views and templates

Do any of the following:
To select the default metadata fields that users encounter when publishing an object, enable the d2l.Tools.LOR.Publish.MetadataView configuration variable.
To set a template with certain values already pre-filled, enable the d2l.Tools.LOR.Publish.MetadataTemplate configuration variable.  




--------------------------------------------------


Enforce metadata tagging

If you require users in your organization to fill in certain metadata fields when publishing learning objects, you must create or edit a custom metadata view in Metadata Administration. Set this custom view as the default metadata view in the d2l.Tools.LOR.Publish.MetadataView configuration variable to ensure users encounter this view and fill in the fields you designate as required. You can only enforce metadata fields for custom views, since built-in system views are not editable. However, your custom view can inherit or copy fields from a built-in system view (such as Asset Metadata), making it identical to the built-in system view and also editable.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Metadata Administration.
Do one of the following:To enforce metadata tagging in a new custom metadata view, click New View. To enforce metadata tagging in an existing custom metadata view, from the View Name column, click the view name.
In the Layout tab, click the field you want to enforce metadata tagging for. You can only enforce metadata tagging for child metadata fields.
In the Field Restrictions section, choose Customize Field Restrictions.
In the Basic Interface Display section, choose Display in Basic Interface.
In the Restrictions area, choose Required and click Save.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Config Variable Browser.
Expand Tools > LOR > Publish and click MetadataView.
In the Org Value field, click the Edit value icon.
From the drop-down list, select Metadata Administration.
Select the custom metadata view you just edited or created.
Click Save.




--------------------------------------------------


Create a repository to store harvested metadata from an external source

On the navbar, click LOR.
From the tool navigation, click Manage.
From the New Repository button, click Metadata Repository.
On the New Metadata Repository page, enter a name and description for the new metadata repository. These fields can use Unicode.
Click Add Resource and type the URL for the harvester to access the metadata. 
Click Verify > Add.
On Resource Settings, specify the harvest date range.
Select Only harvest specific sets within the resource and click Select Sets.
On Resource Sets, click the sets you want to harvest from this repository and click Save. If you don't select options, all learning objects are harvested during searches.
Click Add. Click the Add Another Resource button to add additional locations to the existing list of server locations.

About federated repository searching

Federated repositories are repositories hosted by other institutions that you can access remotely. You can set up access to federated repositories, such as MERLOT, or those using the SRU (Search and Retrieve by URL) protocol.



--------------------------------------------------


Set up access to the MERLOT repository

Before you begin, you must obtain a key from MERLOT, which is available by registering with MERLOT on their site: http://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm.
On the navbar, click LOR.
From the tool navigation, click Manage.
In the Federated Repositories table, click MERLOT.
Click Edit.
Enter your key into the text box.
Click Save.

Authentication and authorization capabilities with third party systems

Brightspace Learning Repository has the same capabilities as Brightspace in terms of integration with:

Integration type


Capabilities


Student Information Systems (SIS)


The user data fields, import formats, IMS Standards, scheduling options, etc., that Brightspace supports are also supported by Brightspace Learning Repository.
This means that Brightspace Learning Repository can mirror the organization structure setup in third party LMS or tools by taking the same data files coming from the SIS.


LDAP/Active Directory


Brightspace Learning Repository supports LDAP and AD in the same way that Brightspace does.


Single Sign-On (SSO)


Brightspace Learning Repository supports the same configurable SSO object that Brightspace does.
3rd party applications can be used to provide authentication into Brightspace Learning Repository, so that users can enter our Brightspace Learning Repository from another application without having to enter or re-enter their login information.
SSO can be setup such that from Brightspace Learning Repository, a link can be created that allows authentication into a third party system.

About Bulk LOR Upload (BLU)

The Brightspace Learning Repository Bulk Upload utility, also known as Bulk LOR Upload (BLU), enables you to upload many learning objects or assets into a Learning Object Repository (LOR) without using the LOR web interface. This is useful for publishing curriculum outlines, syllabuses, or defined assets from your document management system into a searchable repository for use within courses.
Note the following:

Learning Objects can be imported from a SCORM 1.2 compliant content package. 


Assets can be created from any file type. 


BLU can't be used to upload LMS Packages.


BLU doesn't allow publishing of URLs, Topics, Modules or QTI packages.


External metadata for an object or asset can be imported from an IMSMD 1.2.1 compliant XML file.

Enabling the Brightspace Learning Repository Bulk Upload utility
To enable:

Contact D2L Support to enable BLU in your learning environment. Share your desired schedule frequency for the BLU task (Once a day? Once a week?).


Two folders will be available under Organization Files > BLU after initial setup:

Inbox. Upload your files (PDFs, DOCs, Slides, etc.) into this location. Prepare a .txt file with a list of files to be processed. Sample snippet below:

Format: “Repository ID”, “Path and filename”, “Title”, “Description”, “Keyword”, “Role”, “FirstName”, “LastName”, “publish type”


LOR_Bulk_Upload.txt LoadType=CSVMetadata "1006","\\fs-cpledtest\cpledtest\WEB\Content\CPLED\BLU\Inbox\D2LBrightspace.png","ExampleTitle","ExampleDescription","ExampleKeyword","Instructor","NameFirst","NameLast",



Outbox. This where your files and log file will be located after BLU task runs. Check your logs to investigate the LOR import result.


Running the Brightspace Learning Repository Bulk Upload utility
The  Bulk Upload utility normally runs as a scheduled task. It uses a configuration file that identifies the organization containing the repository that objects upload to, and the location of the directory containing the setup (input) files specifying the objects’ source. Each line in the setup file lists the path to a content package or asset file and the repository the file uploads to. Depending on the type of setup file, each line can also list the path to an external metadata file or provide a set of new metadata values to apply during import.  The utility can also identify a specified image file and render it into a thumbnail that showcases the object in the LOR.
When the  Bulk Upload utility finishes processing all the objects or assets in a setup file, it moves the setup file to the output directory specified in the configuration file and begins processing the next setup file. This process continues until all setup files are processed.
As the utility proceeds, it writes progress to a log file stored in the output directory. You can use the log file to verify that all objects are uploaded successfully.
To upload an asset or learning object to the repository:

Ensure that the asset file or content package containing the object is on the server and accessible via a file path (not a URL). If metadata for the asset or object is contained in a separate XML file, ensure that this file is also accessible via a file path.


Create a TXT setup file pointing to the asset file or content package and specify which repository to upload to (or add to an existing setup file).


Save the setup file in the input directory.

The asset or object uploads the next time the utility runs.
To change the timing of the scheduled task, contact D2L Support for assistance.
How the import interprets metadata at multiple levels in a manifest file
When using the Brightspace Learning Repository Bulk Upload utility, an object’s metadata can be located under multiple elements within a manifest file, depending on the type of object and whether the object is a sub-element in the file. If metadata for a single object is found under multiple elements, the following order of precedence is used: <manifest>, <organization>, <item>, <resource>.
For example, if you upload a content package consisting of a module with three topics, and there is metadata under the <manifest> element and under the highest <item> element, both are applicable to the module. The Bulk Upload utility takes the metadata from the <manifest> element and discards the metadata from the <item> element. If one of the topics in the package has metadata under its <item> element and also under the associated <resource> element, the metadata for the <item> element is used and the metadata for the <resource> element is discarded.



--------------------------------------------------


Setup files for the Brightspace Learning Repository Bulk Upload utility

For the Brightspace Learning Repository Bulk Upload utility, setup files are text files placed in the input directory. Once a setup file is processed, it is moved to the output directory. Assets and other files remain in the input directory.
Each setup file begins with a line that denotes the type of setup file, followed by one or more lines pointing to the asset files or content packages to import. Optionally, you can include a line pointing to an external metadata file or specify metadata to apply during import (depending on the type of setup file used).
There are three different types of setup files you can create:

Type 1: Upload content packages containing internal metadata


Type 2: Upload assets or content packages with external metadata in an XML file


Type 3: Upload assets or content packages and apply metadata based on information in the setup file

Each type uses a different format for the lines pointing to import files. You cannot combine these types in a single file; all lines pointing to a file to upload must be in the same format, identified at the beginning of the file.
Note the following: 

The utility doesn’t perform “asset scanning” during upload. If you upload an HTML file as an asset via a Type 2 or Type 3 setup file, links to images or other internal components do not work; only the HTML file is uploaded. The same applies to HTM, JS, and INC files.


You can insert comments in a setup file by starting a line with // (double slash).


The utility ignores empty lines and all other whitespace in set-up files.

Type 1: Content package with internal metadata
First line: LoadType=Package
Subsequent lines: <repository ID>, <path to file>
Fields to include:

<repository ID>	- The repository ID that the object should be created in. IDs are displayed on the LOR Properties page under Admin Tools > Manage Repositories > Repository name > ID.


<path to file>	- The path and file name for the file to upload. Files must be SCORM 1.2 compliant content packages.

Example
LoadType=Package
2,"\\myserver\BulkUpload\input\package1.zip"
2,"\\myserver\BulkUpload\input\package2.zip"
1,"\\myserver\BulkUpload\input\package3.zip"
Type 2: Asset or content package with external metadata
First line: LoadType=XMLMetadata
Subsequent lines: <repository ID>, <path to file>, <path to metadata>
Fields to include:

<repository ID>	- The repository ID that the object should be created in. IDs are displayed on the LOR Properties page under Admin Tools > Manage Repositories > Repository name > ID.


<path to file>	- The path and file name for the file to upload. Files can be SCORM 1.2 compliant content packages or individual asset files.


<path to metadata>	- The path and file name for the metadata file to use. Metadata files must be IMSMD 1.2.1 compliant XML files.

Note:  If you import a content package this way, any metadata in the package is discarded and the metadata in the external file is used exclusively.
Example
LoadType=XMLMetadata
3,"\\myServer\BulkUpload\input\package10.zip","\\myServer\BulkUpload\metadata1.xml"
6,"\\myServer\BulkUpload\input\asset15.gif","\\myServer\BulkUpload\metadata2.xml"
Type 3: Asset or content package with metadata in set-up file
First line: LoadType=CSVMetadata
Subsequent lines: <repository ID>, <path to file>, <title>, <description>, <keyword>, <contributor role>, <contributor first name>, <contributor last name>, <format>
Fields in a type-3 set-up file:

<repository ID> -	The repository ID that the object should be created in. IDs are displayed on the LOR Properties page under Admin Tools > Manage Repositories > Repository name > ID.


<path to file> -	The path and file name for the file to upload. Files can be SCORM 1.2 compliant content packages or individual asset files.


<title> -	The value for the IMSMD field general.title.


<description> -	The value for the IMSMD field general.description.


<keyword> - The value for the IMSMD field general.keyword (single keyword only).


<contributor role> -	The value for the IMSMD field lifecycle.contribute.role*.


<contributor first name> -	The value for the IMSMD field lifecycle.contribute.entity*.


<contributor last name> -	The value for the IMSMD field lifecycle.contribute.entity*.


<format> -	The value for the IMSMD field technical.format.

* The role, first name, and last name are wrapped into a single lifecycle.contribute element.
Note the following:

Enclose all metadata values in double or single quotes, especially if the value contains a comma, an apostrophe, or quotation marks. In the latter two cases, be sure to use the type of punctuation to enclose the value that is not used in the value itself; you can use a single quote or apostrophe in the value if you enclose the string in double quotes, and you can use double quotes in the value if it is enclosed in single quotes.


Any metadata in a content package is discarded and the metadata specified in the setup file is used exclusively.


All metadata values are optional and can be left empty (see the example).

Example
LoadType=CSVMetadata
2,"\\myServer\BulkUpload\input\Asset12.gif","Pomegranate","Photograph of a pomegranate","fruit",,
"Jonathan","Bernstein",
6,"\\myServer\BulkUpload\input\Asset27.mp3","L'inno di Mameli","Italian National Anthem","Italy","Composer","Michele","Navaro",
3,"\\myServer\BulkUpload\input\Asset21.wmv",'"Beat" Takeshi Kitano',,"movies",,,,
Note: The third object in this example uses single quotes around the title so that double quotes can be used in the value.

About ePortfolio

Note: Brightspace Portfolio is intended to replace Brightspace ePortfolio, and it is not recommended that clients use both tools concurrently in the same course.
Brightspace ePortfolio is a personal portfolio tool for storing, organizing, reflecting on, and sharing items that represent your learning. You can include items such as documents, graphics, audio files, videos, presentations, and course work to demonstrate your improvement or mastery in certain areas.
You can control what items you want to include in your portfolio, how they are organized, and who you want to share them with. When you share items with your peers, mentors, or potential employers, you can give them permission to view items, edit items, see or add comments, and see or add assessments to receive feedback.
About org unit sharing groups
Org unit sharing groups allow course designers and administrators to set up sharing groups at the organization, department, or course level and share them with users. Org unit sharing groups can be optional or automatic (mandatory). Automatic sharing groups can be visible in the Sharing Groups area or hidden.
Organization level sharing groups are set up by administration staff and shared with all users in an organization, or a specific set of org units from across the organization. Permissions are cascading; groups you create at the organization or department level are shared with all users enrolled in courses and other child org units. You can restrict which courses or child org units the group is shared with using the Add Org Units filter options.
If you select the Automatically share items with this sharing group option, ensure you let the affected users know they are automatically sharing items, and only apply your org unit sharing group to appropriate roles. You must ensure that your course participants enable comments and assessments for their items if you want to use permissions relating to comments and assessments. If you apply a sharing group to users’ ePortfolios and leave it visible, users can add it to additional items that are not covered by your filter settings.

About Portfolio

Brightspace Portfolio provides an online artifact space that enables a learner to maintain their portfolio evidence from previous years as they progress through their education journey.
Brightspace Portfolio consists of two pieces of software:
To collect evidence in the classroom, use the Portfolio App for iOS or Android on a shared device such as a classroom tablet. The Portfolio app is available for download from Apple App Store or Google Play app store.
To manage the evidence your learners collect, use the Portfolio tool within Brightspace, which is available on a browser from your laptop, tablet, or mobile device.
Note: Brightspace Portfolio is intended to replace Brightspace ePortfolio, and it is not recommended that clients use both tools concurrently.
Troubleshooting: No learners appear in a class
If learners who are enrolled in the class do not appear in the Class Portfolio tab, try the following:
Ensure that there are no connection issues between the Brightspace and the Student Information System (SIS).
Ensure that the classroom is configured to use Brightspace Portfolio. The course must be active and not past the course end date. 
Ensure that the learner permissions are applied for Brightspace Portfolio at the Org level, not just at the course level.



--------------------------------------------------


Set up Portfolio

Turn on Brightspace Portfolio
To allow access to Brightspace Portfolio in your entire organization, turn on the tool.
Tip: You can restrict access to Brightspace Portfolio for specific course offerings. Navigate to the course you want restrict access to, select Course Admin > Tool Status and disable Portfolio. The course no longer appears under the learner’s list of courses in Portfolio.  Due to caching, this change may take time to propagate.
From the Admin Tools menu, select Organization Tools.
Switch the Portfolio toggle to On.
Set the region for Brightspace Portfolio
To use Brightspace Portfolio, the d2l.Tools.Folio.Endpoint variable must be configured to indicate where the Brightspace should look for the Portfolio application, and the region in which the application resides. All configuration variables for Brightspace Portfolio are automatically set up with the same AWS region used by the Brightspace instance in the  d2l.System.Aws.Region configuration variable, unless you manually overwrite the region.
If you intend to change the region, you can update the configuration setting in the Config Variable Browser tool under Tools > Folio.
From the Admin Tools menu, select Organization Related > Config Variable Browser.
Navigate to Tools > Folio.
Click Endpoint.
Click Add Value and add the variable value.
Click Save.
Set Brightspace Portfolio permissions
D2L recommends you use caution when changing the roles and permissions for the Portfolio tool. Editing a permission propagates the change to everyone who currently has the affected role or permission.
Learners need the following permissions:
If your organization has the User Profile tool enabled, the User Profile must have View Other Users' Profiles for the Organization org type. This permission lets learners view other users' profiles with correctly displayed images. 
Portfolio must have Student Portfolio Access for the Organization org type. This permission lets learners view the Portfolio tool in the Brightspace.
Instructors need the following permissions:
Users must have View User Enrollments for Course Offerings and More org type. This permission lets instructors view the learners enrolled in the class.
Users must have Search for {role} for Course Offerings and More org type. This permission lets instructors search for the learners in their classes. The {role} variable indicates the set of roles assigned to the learners enrolled in the course. 
Portfolio must have Can Access the Portfolio Instructor View for Course Offerings and More org type. This permission lets the instructor view the Portfolio tool in the Brightspace. Note that if you provide this permission to Administrators, they appear as an instructor if they have cascading permissions.
If your organization has the User Profile tool enabled, the User Profile must have View other Users' Profiles in order to properly display images.Important: To use Brightspace Portfolio, users with the instructor role must appear in the Classlist tool. From Roles and Permissions, select the instructor role and choose Edit Settings from the context menu. Under Classlist Display Options, enable the Display users enrolled as this role in classlist option.
To assess a rubric attached to evidence, instructors must have the See Rubrics permission at the org level.
The instructor must have the following permissions in User Information Privacy to see user information:
See First Names for Organization and Course Offerings and More org types.
See Last Names  for Organization and Course Offerings and More org types.
See Usernames for Course Offerings and More org type.
See Org Defined IDs for Course Offerings and More org type.
See Email Addresses for Course Offering and More org type.
See Middle Names for Course Offering and More org type.
Users who are administrators of the category tags need the following permissions:
Portfolio must have Can Add Portfolio Tags for the Organization org type. This permission lets the category tag administrator assign categories to evidence collected by learners, instructors, and administrators.
Using Brightspace Parent & Guardian with Portfolio
If you intend to use Brightspace Parent & Guardian to share evidence, it must be configured and turned on in Brightspace under Organization Tools > Brightspace Parent & Guardian.
Choose a workflow for how submitted evidence is managed
By using configuration variables, you can choose a workflow for how submitted evidence  is managed in Brightspace Portfolio. The following workflow you choose depends on your type of organization (K-12, higher education, or corporate) and the level of control you want to grant to learners and instructors.
Evidence approval by instructors
In this workflow, instructors must approve each piece of submitted evidence before it appears in each learner's portfolio. This workflow is ideal for young learners in a K-12 learning environment  where they may need more guidance and supervision on evidence collection.
To enable this workflow, turn off the  d2l.Tools.Folio.LearnerControlsEvidenceSharing configuration variable. This configuration variable is off by default.
Evidence sharing with instructors
In this workflow, learners collect evidence and choose when to share it with instructors for assessment. This workflow is ideal for learners in a higher education  learning environment where they may have work in progress that is not ready to share with instructors. For instructors, this allows them to only see evidence that is carefully curated by the learner for review, feedback, and assessment.
To enable this workflow, turn on the  d2l.Tools.Folio.LearnerControlsEvidenceSharing configuration variable.
Evidence not linked to a course
 In this workflow, learners collect evidence and choose not to link it to a course. This workflow is ideal for older learners in a higher education or corporate learning environment, as they may not be enrolled in courses, but still need to collect evidence of learning in an independent location where assessment by an instructor is unnecessary. For example, extracurricular activities, internships, or independent learning/research.
To enable this workflow, turn on the  d2l.Tools.Folio.EvidenceOutsideOfCourses configuration variable.
Verify that courses are active
Any course or class that you want to set up with Brightspace Portfolio must be active. If you attempt to set up Brightspace Portfolio in a course that is deactivated, Brightspace Portfolio may not work as expected. 
Important: If the d2l.Security.BypassDateCheck configuration variable is turned on, course start and end dates are ignored. This setting is useful when you want learners to have early access to courses or continued access after courses end. In Brightspace, courses outside of their start and end dates appear with other active courses in the My Courses widget; however, they display as grayed out (inactive). In Brightspace Portfolio, courses outside of their start and end dates appear with other active courses, with no difference in how they display. Even though a course may not have started yet, learners have early access to the course portfolio. However, if a course has ended, the course and any evidence remain in the list of active courses and list of evidence for the learner's portfolio. In addition, current instructors do not see archived portfolios belonging to learners. If turning on the d2l.Security.BypassDateCheck configuration variable is beneficial to your organization, you can archive a course portfolio by editing the course offering information and turning off the Course is active checkbox.
To ensure the course is active:
From the Admin Tools menu, click Course Management.
Search for the course offering name and click to select the course.
On the navbar, click Course Admin > Course Offering Information.
Ensure the Course is Active check box is selected. 
Add a Portfolio link to the navbar
In Brightspace, instructors can manage Portfolio from a link on the navbar.
Note: Learners can access Portfolio from their username on the navbar > My Portfolio. This link is always visible and cannot be disabled.
From the Admin Tools menu, select Navigation and Themes.
Click the navbar where you want to add the Brightspace Portfolio link.
In the Links section, click Add Links.
Select Portfolio and save the navbar.
Note: To add a Portfolio link for learners on the navbar, use the custom  link option: Add Links > Create Custom Link.



--------------------------------------------------


Portfolio categories

Manage school-provided categories
You can create   school-provided categories for instructors to classify evidence collected from learners, based on the specific requirements of the school. You can also enable instructors to create additional categories for their own classes.  Instructors can  access  the categories they create in all their classes. Instructors can also see and use any categories that were added by instructors that are also part of their class, so that co-teachers in a classroom can use the same categories. Other instructors not a part of the classroom do not see these instructor-created categories. 
Note: Ensure users have the Can Add Portfolio Tags permission for the Organization org type if you want to enable instructor-created categories. 
Create a school-provided category
In Brightspace, click Admin Tools.
Under Organization Related, click Portfolio Category Management.
Enter a new category name.
Click Save.
Edit a category 
In Brightspace, click Admin Tools.
Under Organization Related, click Portfolio Category Management.
Click the ... Category Menu icon for the category you want to edit.

Manage learner and data access in Brightspace Pulse

To meet learner expectations and maintain a consistent Brightspace experience, Brightspace Pulse is enabled by default. However, your organization may choose to disable learner access to Brightspace Pulse.
To enable or disable Brightspace Pulse
From the Admin Tools menu, click Manage Extensibility.
Select the Brightspace Pulse - iOS and Brightspace Pulse - Android checkboxes. 
Click Enable or Disable.
Tip: To promote Brightspace Pulse usage in your organization, you can choose to display a banner in the learner view of the Grades tool and each user's Notifications Settings page.  The banner displays to all learners, regardless of whether they have Brightspace Pulse installed or not, until the banner is explicitly dismissed. The banner includes links to the Brightspace Pulse app from the Google Play and Apple App Store. Users can permanently dismiss the banner by clicking X. By default, the banner displays; however, you can hide the banner by turning off the d2l.System.Mobile.ImproveAppDiscoverability configuration variable.
Data access in Brightspace Pulse
To allow administrators and instructors to see when learners log in and access courses from Brightspace Pulse, the app sends session and course access events to the Brightspace Data Platform (BDP). The BDP stores these events, and then computes and stores the aggregated data, which can then be accessed through various course reporting tools, such as Classlist, Class Progress, Adoption Dashboard, Engagement Dashboard, and the Course Overview widget. For example, in Classlist, the Last Accessed column displays a timestamp when a learner accesses a course from Brightspace Pulse.
Note the following:

Brightspace Pulse only reports on the completion of content topics and when they were last opened, not the time spent in a particular topic. For most content topics (including videos), they are marked as complete when the learner opens the topic, not how much time they spent in the topic. This is consistent with how content completion is recorded in Brightspace. For more information on tracking the time spent viewing content in Brightspace, see the Class Progress documentation.


In Data Hub, the Course Access Log data set captures the date and time when a user initially accesses a course, then creates additional rows for every 30 minutes that the user spends in the course.


The Course Access data set  does not include Brightspace Pulse data.





--------------------------------------------------


Sign into Brightspace Pulse

Brightspace Pulse authenticates users with OAuth2. Brightspace Pulse and the Authentication Service do not work with self-signed, expired, or invalid certificates. 
If your organization uses a third-party portal for users to login, then you must use the same target parameter already configured for other D2L apps to allow SSO tokens to pass between the Brightspace platform and Brightspace Pulse. Documentation for this is available on Managing Learning Service User Authentication.
To sign into Pulse with OAuth2

From your device, tap the Brightspace Pulse icon.

Notifications in Brightspace Pulse

Brightspace Pulse provides learners with notifications that offer them tips and keep them informed about course-related news, updates, quizzes, assignments, and grades. These notifications display in the Notifications tab in Brightspace Pulse.
The types of updates learners see are controlled by configuration variables set by administrators or options set by instructors. 
Note: After logging in for the first time, course updates do not appear until new updates are created in Brightspace.
In Brightspace Pulse, the Updates and Subscriptions tabs show the same items as the Alert Bell and Discussions in Brightspace.
All Brightspace alerts display within the Pulse Updates and Subscriptions tabs.
Brightspace Pulse does not send alerts from courses that cannot be accessed (inactive or beyond the end date).
Notifications types in Brightspace Pulse
Created or updated course content
To keep learners up to date with course content, Brightspace Pulse sends notifications when course content is created or updated in Brightspace.
The d2l.Tools.Content.AllowCreationNotifications configuration variable notifies users about new content. By default:
System Value is enabled and requires D2L Support to disable it.
Org Value is not set. System administrators can set this value to override the system value for the current org. 
Course content updates only appear in Brightspace Pulse and Brightspace  if the instructor selects the Notify students that the content has changed option for the updated content in Brightspace. This option provides updates for the Classic Content experience only; notifications are not sent for the New Content experience (Lessons).
Created or updated course content using the Brightspace APIs
When content is added or updated using the Brightspace APIs, developers can choose to send the same notifications that are sent when content is added or updated through Brightspace. These notifications appear in Brightspace and Brightspace Pulse. 
This functionality requires a system administrator to set the following role permissions:
Content > Create and Edit Modules and Topics
Notifications > Receive Instant Notifications
Notifications > Receive Digest Notifications
Use the Brightspace APIs to add or modify a content topic, setting the parameter to send a notification as part of the addition or change.
For detailed information about setting parameters, see the Brightspace API documentation.
Course activity in Activity Feed
If the Activity Feed widget is enabled in a learner’s enrolled courses, Brightspace Pulse displays Activity Feed notifications to keep learners up to date on course activity.
Created or updated Course Overview documents
When an instructor adds or updates the Course Overview document in Brightspace, learners receive notifications in Brightspace Pulse and Brightspace. 
Note:
The Course Overview document is stored in the Content tool in Brightspace. The document does not appear in the module/topic hierarchy in the table of contents.
The d2l.Tools.Content.AllowOverviewNotifications configuration variable notifies users about new or updated Course Overview documents. By default:
System Value is enabled and can only be disabled by D2L Support.
Org Value is enabled. System administrators can set this value to override the system value for the current org.
In Brightspace, learners can then optionally choose to receive instant notifications via email or text message when the Course Overview document is updated. 
Course announcements
When an instructor wants to communicate changes to course updates, information, and reminders via course announcements, learners receive a course announcement notification in Brightspace Pulse. 
From the Announcements tool, an instructor creates or updates the announcement, selects the Major edit - send a notification and restore it for those who dismissed it option, and then clicks Update.
New grades
When an instructor enters grades, learners receive grade notifications in Brightspace Pulse.
From a grade book, an instructor enters the learner's grade, sending a notification to the learner in Brightspace and Brightspace Pulse.
Upcoming quizzes and assignments
Learners receive push notifications that remind them about upcoming quizzes and assignments. By default, notifications display two days before each activity's due date or end date. Org Administrators can set the following separate configuration variables to specific hours or days:

d2l.Tools.Dropbox.ApproachingEndDateThreshold


d2l.Tools.Quizzing.ApproachingEndDateThreshold

Note: These configuration variables apply to the entire org.
Learners receive a notification in Brightspace and Brightspace Pulse under the following conditions:

If the assignment or quiz has a due date, the learner is notified two days before the due date.


If the assignment or quiz has no due date, but has an end date, the learner is notified two days before the end date.

Learners do not receive a notification in Brightspace and Brightspace Pulse under the following conditions:

Learner completed the assignment by submitting to the assignment folder.


Learner completed the quiz according to the defined completion criteria (attempt submitted or score threshold achieved).


The assignment or quiz has no dates attached.


The assignment or quiz includes only a start date.

@Mentions Notifications
Brightspace Instructors (depending on your permissions) can use @mention push notifications to direct a message to Learners using Pulse. When a user is @mentioned, that user is notified of the message. 
Note: These notifications can be viewed in the Pulse Notifications > Subscriptions area and are still available in Discussions. @Mentions are currently not supported in Activity Feed. 
The default setting for the notifications is either on or off based on the user's settings. Users can control their notification settings by choosing to have them on or off in the Pulse app settings.
To send an @mention push notification to a user

In Discussions under a Discussion topic, write a message and @mention a user. For example, "@name".


Post the Discussion response with the @mention to notify the user.

When users receive an @mention push notification, the notification is available in Pulse Notifications > Subscriptions. These @mention notifications indicate, for example, "You've been mentioned in the Discussion topic XYZ" and link to the Brightspace web page with that content. 
The Subscriptions sub-tab displays all replies to discussions learners are subscribed to and @-mentions in discussion threads.
Note: To receive subscription notifications in Brightspace Pulse, learners must subscribe to discussions from the Discussions tool in Brightspace. To receive @-mentions in discussion threads, the d2l.Tools.WYSIWYG.Mention configuration variable must be turned on.

Add deep links in custom apps to Brightspace Pulse

To promote Brightspace Pulse usage in organizations, developers can add a deep link in a custom app to Brightspace Pulse. When a user clicks the deep link in a custom app for the first time, the Brightspace Pulse app launches on their device, prompting them to log in to the app. If the user does not have Brightspace Pulse installed, they are taken to the Brightspace Pulse app site, prompting them to install the app.
Note the following:
This feature is available to all clients with Brightspace Pulse 1.2001 or later.
Users with Brightspace Pulse on iOS 12 or older must approve Brightspace Pulse to open the deep link in Safari. The custom app does not ask for approval again and always opens Brightspace Pulse directly from the deep link.
Deep links in iOS applications
To support deep links in iOS applications, Brightspace Pulse for iOS uses Universal Links. To add a deep link to Brightspace Pulse from an iOS application, add the following code snippet to open the deep link URL in Safari:
if let url = URL(string: "https://apps.brightspace.com/pulse/launch"), UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(url) {
UIApplication.shared.open(url, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)
}
Deep links in Android applications
To support deep links in Android applications, Brightspace Pulse for Android uses Android App Links. To add a deep link to Brightspace Pulse from an Android application, add the following code snippet to launch an activity with the deep link URL:
startActivity(Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("https://apps.brightspace.com/pulse/launch")))



--------------------------------------------------


Brightspace Pulse Organization Search

How does my LMS appear in the Pulse App? How do learners find us?
Pulse features a workflow called Discovery for new users to find the URL to connect to their Brightspace environment by using their geo-location. Otherwise, the user can type the name of their school, district, employer, or institution and search for it.
There is also a simple search functionality. For example, if your institution is called "University of Wakanda", then it will show for various terms including "Wakanda", "U of W", or "UW".

Figure: Use Brightspace Pulse's Discovery workflow to find Brightspace environments based on your geo-location.
What name appears in the listing?
The organization name that appears in the Pulse search is driven by the top-level org name in Brightspace.
This name is set and can be changed by navigating to Admin Tools > Org Unit Editor. Then, with the top-level organization selected (Default), select Edit Properties. The field labeled Name determines the name that appears in Pulse. For more information, refer to About Org Unit Editor.
How do I change the URL that shows up in the listing?
The URL that displays below the name in Pulse is driven by the d2l.Settings.WebServerName config in the config variable browser.

Figure: Search for your Brightspace environment in Pulse by manually entering your institution's name.
How long will it take for changes to appear in Pulse?
Both the name and URL are updated daily. There can be a delay of up to 48 hours after a name change.
How do I manually enter my institution's URL?
If you want to manually enter your institutions URL, type “zzz” into the search bar. No results will show up and you will be prompted to manually enter your URL.

Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups (Manager Dashboard) is a set of tools for managers, learning directors, and administrators that helps manage enrollment and track course completion of employees in an organization.
You must have the specific role permissions and user attributes properly configured before you can use these tools.
Manager Dashboard consists of the following tools:
Learning Groups – creates collections of employees with similar training needs. You can create attribute rules which automatically create groups based on common attributes amongst groups, such as Department-Engineering, or Location - 10th floor. Alternatively, you can manually assign members based on any corporate need; for example, new hires, first aid responders, or special interest groups within your organization. Access this tool by clicking Learning Groups on the navbar.
Manager Dashboard - provides information about a manager's direct reports and teams such as learning path enrollment, course enrollment and completion details, course due dates, and overdue course alerts. You can manually assign people who report to you directly or indirectly to courses if you have this permission. Access this tool by clicking Manager Dashboard on the navbar.
Attributes management – enables administrators to define and assign important data that identifies all employees in the organization for organizing and assigning them into learning groups and courses.
Course Completion Tracking – enables managers to track the completion status of courses they assign to their teams and Learning Groups.
Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups can work with the Learning Paths tool to assign learning paths to learning groups, and monitor the completion of courses in learning paths for direct reports.

Platform and User Role Requirements

Platform requirements
Manager Dashboard   is compatible with Brightspace platform 10.7.11 and higher. Your organization must be running the Brightspace Core product for your segment. The Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups tools are only available to Corporate Clients running Brightspace Core, or Education clients who have purchased the Upskilling add-on package. 
Your instance must have Brightspace Data Platform and Data Hub enabled to turn on Manager Dashboard.
User role requirements
Manager Dashboard  requires all users who will be assigned to courses to have one consistent course level role. You must choose this role to set up your Manager Dashboard. Typically, this role is the Learner role. As part of setup, the ID of this role is required. This appears in the URL of the Edit Permissions page of the user role you choose. The ID number appears at the end of the page URL.
Note: Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups remain in an empty state and not available to view until the Learner role is correctly configured. A screen appears with the message: "Manager Dashboard/Learning Groups isn't ready". 
User role recommendations
Thoughtful role planning is required for Manager Dashboard users. D2L recommends setting up the following (or similar) org-level roles for Manager Dashboard:
Learning/Development Manager or Administrator – this role requires access to Attributes management and the Learning Groups tool.
People/Teams Manager – this role requires access to the Manager Dashboard tool to view their teams, assign users to courses, and view user progress through courses. 
Learners – this role is required for any user who may be enrolled in a course manually or automatically based on their attributes.
Note: Manager Dashboard is an org level tool that requires users to have an org level role, in addition to any other org unit or course level role they may have. When a learner is enrolled in a course or an org unit, they may be assigned a new role in that course or org unit, but they would still retain their org level role for org level tools such as Manager Dashboard. However, when users change jobs at their organization, they may get a different org level role assigned.



--------------------------------------------------


Manager Dashboard configuration variables

Important: Depending on the settings you choose, you may require specific attributes and user roles and permissions to complete the desired configuration for your organization. D2L recommends engagement with D2L Implementation Services to configure a custom option for your organization.
 
Variable
Type 
Default value
Description
d2l.Tools.ManagerRole.CoursesAvailableToAssign
Org
All Courses
Sets the visibility of courses  for managers when assigning courses to learners in Manager Dashboard.
d2l.Tools.CompletionTracking.DisplayPercProgress
Course
Off
Displays the courses that have the Display % Progress completion tracking option enabled. Sets Display % Progress completion tracking  when Course Completion Tracking is enabled in a course. 




--------------------------------------------------


Setting course assignment restrictions for Managers

You can choose from four options that restrict the courses available to managers when assigning courses to learners. Managers with restricted course assignment options can only select from designated courses in the org unit type when assigning courses. Other courses that are available in the organization are unavailable to the manager within the Assign Courses workflow. 
The options are controlled by the configuration variable: d2l.Tools.ManagerRole.CoursesAvailableToAssign. 
The following course assignment settings are available:
All Courses (default)
Self-Enrollment Courses only
Only Courses Determined by Attributes
Self-Enrollment courses and courses determined by Attributes
To determine courses available to managers using Attributes, a reserved attribute type is available in the CSV template provided by D2L called Affiliated Org Units. Entering org unit codes (such as a Department org unit code) as attribute values for each user with the Manager role now makes only those courses affiliated with the org unit code available for assignment by managers. To provide multiple org units with affiliated courses (like Departments), you can enter multiple attribute values as an array (using the standard set by the D2L Standard CSV). 
Notes:
The new attribute type is a reserved attribute type  that cannot be used to create or alter learning groups. Org unit codes are not available within the Rules Builder of Learning Groups. However, the org unit codes are visible to administrators on the User Attributes page. 
When providing attribute values for Affiliated Org Units, you can provide up to 10 values per user .
Org unit codes must be unique to ensure they map to the corresponding org unit ID.
Values for the Affiliated Org Unit attribute must be maintained manually. If an Org Unit Code is changed at the course level, the system will not update any attribute values impacted by this change. In this case, the updated Org Unit Code must be imported into the User Attributes tool.




--------------------------------------------------


Importing Attributes

The Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups tools require information about users that are most likely maintained in your Human Resources Information System (HRIS). These features rely on your organization’s hierarchy, reporting structure, and other attributes that you must specify to enable managers and learning administrators to enroll users into groups and courses.
D2L requires uploading a CSV file to define and maintain the attributes associated to users and import them into Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups. You may be able to set up an auto-generated CSV file that regularly updates employee information from your organization’s HRIS to update Manager Dashboard. (Ensure that the CSV file size is no larger than 2GB.) 
D2L offers three potential access points for uploading a CSV file of employee attributes from your HRIS to Manager Dashboard:
Manual upload via the user interface of Brightspace. Access the Attributes tool in the Admin tools menu of LE. You can  manually import your CSV file from the Bulk Attribute Upload tab using the provided file template  every time you have an employee update. 
Integration Pack for Student Information Systems (IPSIS) – D2L Standard CSV Integration. To learn more about this option, refer to: Using IPSIS to import user attributes.
API service - To learn how to develop your API solution to import user attributes, contact your D2L representative (Implementation Services, Account Management, or Customer Success).
 Note: D2L recommends engagement with D2L Implementation Services to configure a custom option for your organization.
CSV validation
The CSV validation checks applies to all three import methods (Manual, API and IPSIS):
Files will not process if any validation error is detected.
Only required columns must be present in CSV file. Any missing required column will fail validation. Any other missing column is ignored.
Only select users need to be in the CSV file (i.e. doesn’t require all users). Only listed users are processed.
Any empty cell will be processed as a deletion of that attribute value for the user.
Invalid column not in schema will fail validation.
Invalid CSV (i.e. un-escaped string values) will fail validation.
The system looks up each “user” datatype (username, manager) in Brightspace and any invalid match will fail validation.
Any value not in range defined by schema will fail validation.
String checks string length.
Date checks date range.
CSV file size must be less than 2GB.
The d2l.Tools.ManagerRole.CoursesAvailableToAssign configuration variable must be set correctly for the Affiliated Org Units reserved attribute to process. 
Download the CSV file template from Brightspace
Before you begin: Ensure the d2l.Tools.ManagerRole.CoursesAvailableToAssign configuration variable is set with the correct course assignment option for your organization. 
From the Admin Tools menu, click Attributes.
Click Bulk Attribute Upload.
Click Download template.
Important: If you do not have data for any of the defined attributes, remove the header from the template. Those columns will be ignored during import. Individual cells can also be left blank. These attributes will be left undefined on the first import, or will clear any defined data on subsequent imports. 
If you want to set course assignment availability using Attributes, ensure the User Attributes are correctly updated with the org unit codes of departments with courses that are available to managers, in addition to setting the configuration variable.
Import attributes manually
Before you begin: 
Ensure that all users have the correct roles and required permissions in Brightspace. All users must already exist in Brightspace before you can associate attributes to them. 
Ensure the d2l.Tools.ManagerRole.CoursesAvailableToAssign configuration variable is set with the correct course assignment option for your organization. 
From the Admin Tools menu, click Attributes.
Click Bulk Import.
Select the CSV file you want to import.
Click Apply changes.
Using IPSIS to import user attributes
Before you begin: Ensure the d2l.Tools.ManagerRole.CoursesAvailableToAssign configuration variable is set with the correct course assignment option for your organization. 
You must use the D2L Standard CSV option to import user attributes to Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups. This requires you to zip your CSV files (even if you are only uploading a single file).
The system  checks for new files to process in the designated SFTP site every 10 minutes.
D2L recommends using  the Users D2L Standard CSV version 1.1.
The IPSIS Administration Dashboard provides the processing status of the latest batch. Both the Dashboard and Batches pages will show a final indicator if the batch completed successfully or with errors. Each batch has a quick link to the Audit Log and if completed with errors to Error Messages.

Course Completion Tracking in Manager Dashboard

Course Completion Tracking is a course-level tool available in Course Administration. Enabling Course Completion Tracking provides managers with a visual progress bar of a learner's progression through a course. By default, Manager Dashboard logs a course as completed when all required activities in the Table of Contents of the course are completed. You must enable completion tracking for each course offering you want to assign to learners in Manager Dashboard. Note that you must have the Manage Completion Tracking permission assigned to your role to turn on completion tracking, as well as permissions to access and edit the courses.
There are two settings available for viewing course completion: 
Text-based progress  - this option displays a simple tracking summary. The progress is indicated by three states: Not Started, In Progress or Complete. 
Display % Progress bar - this option displays the percentage of course completion based on the number of completed topics out of the total topics available  in a course.
Display % Progress is selected by default when enabling Course Completion Tracking for each course, although users can deselect this option to use the original text-based progress setting instead. For courses that have Course Completion Tracking previously enabled, you can enable the Display % Progress option using the d2l.Tools.CompletionTracking.DisplayPercProgress configuration variable in the Config Variable Browser, if you have the required permissions to edit configuration variables.
Notes:
Manager Dashboard reports on completion status of courses in real time. When a content topic is viewed in Brightspace or  Brightspace Pulse, it is automatically read as complete in the Table of Contents. When all the content topics of a course are completed, the course reports to Manager Dashboard as complete.

To exclude a topic from completion tracking, you can set it as Not Required in the Table of Contents editing options or the Activity Tab in the topic.

If a course includes release conditions that releases content at a future date, the topic that unlocks the future content will be marked as complete, but the future topic is not counted when calculating course completion. This may cause a course to be incorrectly recorded as complete by Manager Dashboard. Courses will not revert to incomplete status if they have already been marked complete.
Content topics that include a SCORM package using the new SCORM solution are read by Manager Dashboard as complete when the completion criteria within the SCORM package is met. Only SCORM packages using the new solution include completion reporting data.
If a quiz is included in the Table of Contents of course content, then you must set the completion criteria for it. You can choose to have the quiz marked as complete after the learner submits a quiz attempt or you can set a minimum passing grade for the quiz.

You can include an assignment in your completion tracking criteria for a course by adding it as an activity in the Table of Contents.  By default, an assignment is marked as complete when a learner submits a file for the assignment. 

Enable the Completion Tracking tool in Brightspace
From the Admin Tools menu, click Tools.
Click Completion Tracking to On.
Enable Completion Tracking for a course
Before you begin: ensure you have the appropriate permissions to edit the course. You must enable Course Completion Tracking  before learners begin the course. Enabling completion tracking after learners have started a course, disabling and re-enabling completion tracking, or removing required topics from the table of contents of a course in-progress  may result in incomplete completion data in Manager Dashboard and Learning Groups. 
If your organization uses Learning Paths, you can set Completion Tracking for courses that are added to learning paths, but the Completion Tracking service is not used by Learning Paths to track learner progress through courses or the overall learning path. Completion tracking is only used by Manager Dashboard.
Access the course you want to track.
From the Course Administration page, click Course Completion Tracking.
Select the check box Enable Completion Tracking for this Course. Note: by default, the Display % Progress check box is selected simultaneously. Clearing the Display % Progress check box keeps completion tracking enabled but displays  text-based progress  instead of the  calculated percentage progress bar. 
Click Save and Close.
Set the Display % Progress option using the Config Variable Browser
You can set Course Completion Tracking to Display % Progress for courses that already have Course Completion Tracking enabled using the d2l.Tools.CompletionTracking.DisplayPercProgress configuration variable in the Config Variable Browser. This configuration variable is set to off by default.
Note: Using the Config Variable Browser to enable Display % Progress is optional. D2L recommends enabling Display % Progress on the Course Completion Tracking page in the course. This configuration variable only enables the Display % Progress setting for Course Completion Tracking, it does not enable the Course Completion Tracking tool or feature. If Course Completion Tracking is not already enabled in the course offering you edit in the Config Variable Browser, then the configuration variable will not function.
Before you begin: you must have the appropriate permissions to access and edit configuration variables in Brightspace.
From the Admin Tools menu, click Config Variable Browser.
Navigate to the d2l.Tools.CompletionTracking.DisplayPercProgress configuration variable.
Click Add Value.
Enter the Org Unit ID or click the Select Org Unit button and click on the org unit. Click Update.
	In the Value dropdown menu, click on.
Click Save.
Set completion tracking for a quiz
Set the completion criteria for quizzes that are included in the Table of Contents of a course.
Before you begin: ensure you have the appropriate permissions to edit quizzes and course content.
Access the quiz in the course you want to track.
From the dropdown menu of the quiz you want to track, click Edit.
Click the Assessment tab.
In the Activity Completion Tracking area, select the Automatic Completion Condition you want. Remember to allow multiple attempts on the quiz if you select the Passing Grade option.

--------------------------------------------------


Setting due dates for assigned courses

You can set due dates when assigning individual courses in Learning Groups, as well as edit and remove due dates for previously assigned courses. The due date specifies the date the course must be completed by all the learners in the group. A course is considered completed when the learner has viewed all content and completed all quizzes.
Learning Groups offers two options for setting due dates for courses:
Specific Dates set a specific date to complete the assigned course for all members of the group, no matter when they are added to the group.
Relative Dates sets the due date for the assigned course to a specified number of days from the date of course assignment. This option ensures that each member of the learning group has the same number of days to complete the course, no matter when they are added to the Learning Group.
After a due date is set for an assigned course in Learning Groups, the due date appears in Manager Dashboard to enable managers to track user progress through a course. Overdue course alerts appear in Manager Dashboard for individual learners who do not complete their courses by the set due date.
Notes:
You must enable Course Completion Tracking for each course before you can set a due date. Ensure that completion tracking remains enabled for any courses with a due date.
D2L recommends only setting due dates for active courses with no end date. 
You cannot set due dates for the learning paths you assign using Learning Groups.

Setting restrictions on people and learning in Learning Groups

Restrictions enable you to limit the groups of people and learning that are available for assignment to Learning Groups. Only users and learning that match the restriction criteria are available to be added to learning groups. If no restrictions are set, all users and learning from all org units are visible in the Learning Groups tool and available for automatic and manual assignment to learning groups.
D2L recommends setting up restrictions for Learning Groups upon initial implementation of the tool. For additional information, refer to the Locked Learning Groups product blog post in Brightspace Community.
