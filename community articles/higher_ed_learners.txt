Awards

The My Awards tool enables  learners  to see merit-based awards granted by instructors of a course. There are two types of awards: Badges and Certificates.
Badges are awarded based on any criteria determined by the instructor. They are meant to provide digital markers that represent accomplishment throughout a course or program. Badges do not contribute to achieving a passing grade; however, badges are awarded for achievements that also can contribute to the type of work ethic that results in a passing grade. For example, an instructor might create a badge that is based on posting 15 discussion posts in the first month of a course, or on perfect attendance, or on academic excellence. These items are the types of trends that can help a learner to succeed in a course or program. 
Certificates are also awarded based on criteria determined by the instructor. Certificates are similar to Badges; however, they include a PDF that learners can print. Certificates typically indicate an official statement of certification or award at the end of a program, but can be awarded during the course for other criteria as well. Certificates can be awarded based on achieving a milestone that a learner can use for further academic or career success, such as passing a practical exam. Certificates also do not contribute to achieving a passing grade. 
You can view the awards you've earned and the awards available to be earned in the My Awards tool. All awards are displayed as images and you can click on an image to view more details. You might also be able to view awards in the Awards Leaderboard widget on your course homepage.

Brightspace Virtual Assistant

Brightspace Virtual Assistant is an AI-based help tool that is integrated directly into Brightspace as a pop-up window from the speech bubble button in the bottom right corner of the screen. It provides immediate access to help documentation without needing to open another browser tab or window. After typing in a question, the tool provides the most relevant documentation available in Brightspace Community.
Get acquainted with Brightspace by accessing support documentation for all your how-to questions and connect to live agents directly in the LMS. Instructors can find step-by-step guides and video tutorials on how to set up their course and its respective activities directly within the product rather than in a new browser tab or window.

If users still need more assistance, they can contact a live support agent directly from Brightspace, without seeking D2L End User Support contact information elsewhere.

Note: If a userâs chosen Language and Locale is not one of the four languages mentioned above, the default experience will be in English.

About Brightspace ePortfolio

Brightspace ePortfolio is a personal portfolio tool for storing, organizing, reflecting on, and sharing items that represent your learning. You can include items such as documents, graphics, audio files, videos, presentations, and course work to demonstrate your improvement or mastery in certain areas.
You can control what items you want to include in your portfolio, how they are organized, and who you want to share them with. When you share items with your peers, mentors, or potential employers, you can give them permission to view items, edit items, see or add comments, and see or add assessments to receive feedback.
Brightspace ePortfolio user interface overview

Figure: Brightspace ePortfolio is divided into 4 main pages: the Dashboard, the My Items page, the Explore page, and the Sharing Groups page.
Page

Description

Brightspace ePortfoloio Dashboard

The Dashboard is the main landing page for Brightspace ePortfolio. On the Dashboard, you can add new content to your Brightspace ePortfolio, review recent activity on your items and items shared with you, and check invites from your peers.
 							The "What are you learning?" panel prompts you to record brief thoughts about a current learning experience that you can expand on at a later date. You can also add file artifacts or a link artifact to your Brightspace ePortfolio or associate them with your brief reflection. When you post an item, it automatically shares with the default sharing group you specify in your Brightspace ePortfolio settings. 
The Announcements feed consolidates recent activity on your items and items shared with you. Your items appear in this area if they have been recently edited, commented on, or assessed. If you contribute a comment, an edit, or an assessment to another user's item, that item also appears in the Announcements feed and you can see contributions others are making to it. 
Filters at the top of the Announcements feed enables you to search and view specific sets of content: recent activity by ownership, people and items you've subscribed to, and items from contacts in the Instant Messages tool via the Friends List. 						The Unread Invites panel displays your recent invites, including the author of the invite, the message content, and the associated Brightspace ePortfolio item.

My Items

The My Items page consolidates all of your artifacts, reflections, presentations, collections, and learning objectives into a single view, enabling you to view, search, and manage all of your content from one location. On the My Items page you can: 

								Add Brightspace ePortfolio content using the New Presentation, New Collection, and Add buttons. 


								Bulk add items to a presentation or collection or bulk associate items with learning objectives using the More Actions button. 


									Perform common actions on your Brightspace ePortfolio items, such as view, preview (image and HTML file artifacts only), edit, copy (presentations only), delete, and share. 

Your Brightspace ePortfolio items display in a list that you can sort and filter. 

Explore

The Explore page consolidates items others have shared publicly or privately with you into one view. Shared Brightspace ePortfolio items display in a list that you can sort and filter. On the Explore page you can: 
						Browse items.
Depending on your sharing permissions, view and leave comments and assessments and edit others' items. A feedback activity icon appears beside items when there is comment and assessment activity.
Click on a user's name to view all content shared from that user. 
Subscribe to an item or a user. 
Search for content. The search checks for matches within item titles, tags, descriptions, and owner names. 

Sharing Groups
The Sharing Groups page displays all sharing groups to which you are a member. Use a sharing group to apply and save permissions for different users and groups of users. This allows you to attach the sharing group to new and existing items rather than specifying permissions for each item you create.

What are activity icons?
Once you share items with others and they provide comments or rubric assessments, on the My Items page, icons that represent this activity appear beside your items. 
You can click on these icons to view details about which individuals or groups you are sharing an item with or to review comments and rubric assessments made on that item. 
Clicking on the sharing group icon or individual icon opens an item's Sharing Settings dialog. From here you can modify who can access your item. Clicking on the feedback icon opens an item's View page where you can review comments and rubric assessments from others.

Create and manage Brightspace ePortfolio presentations

Presentations let you compile Brightspace ePortfolio items into a web project to showcase your achievements. Your presentations can have multiple pages. Presentations provide a polished, professional medium to demonstrate your learning and accomplishments.

You can include additional text in the banner as a description. The theme of the presentation controls the style of the banner, including the background and fonts used. 
Themes are default style templates that give your presentations a consistent look and feel. Themes are comprised of styles that control one aspect of the design. For example, there are separate styles that control the look of titles, links, dates, and images.

Share Brightspace ePortfolio items with external users
You can also share Brightspace ePortfolio presentations externally with friends, parents, or potential employers in the following two ways: 
You can make the presentation publicly available to anyone through a URL. When you share a presentation this way people can only view the presentation. They cannot add comments, add assessments, or make edits to the presentation. 
You can send a personal invite to view your presentation via an email and the recipient can follow the attached link to view the presentation. The recipient must set up a username and password, and then they can see and add comments or assessments based on the permissions you gave them. External users cannot edit presentations. 
Send an invitation to a user
Have another user join you in your learning by sending them an invitation to your ePortfolio items. You can send invitations to internal users when you share an item with them. Sending an invitation gives you the opportunity to leave them a message about why you are sharing the item and what youâd like them to do with it. If you send an invite to a sharing group that includes all users at your organization or all users in a particular course or department, all of the users in the group receive the invite.

About viewing shared items
There are various ways for you to discover, categorize, follow, and review content shared with you in Brightspace ePortfolio. 

Sharing Method


Description 


Invites


Invites enable you to promote the content you're sharing with specific people. An invite contains information about who shared the item, when it was shared, what type of item it is, and any description or tags it has. The sender might also include a message letting you know why they shared the item. 
When you receive an invite from another user to view an item in their Brightspace ePortfolio, a notification appears on the minibar and the invite displays on your Brightspace ePortfolio dashboard in the Unread Invites area. In addition, you might receive an email informing you of the invite. You can also subscribe to the Invite RSS feed in your Brightspace ePortfolio  Settings to receive external updates about new invites. 


Subscriptions


Subscriptions enable you to follow activity on items or from specific people that interest you. You can subscribe to user or item activity from your dashboard, the Explore page, or your invites. 
Use the Subscriptions filter on your dashboard to view activity on items or from users you subscribed to. Recent subscription activity also appears in your minibar alerts.  


Friends List


Use the Friends List filter on the dashboard to view content shared with you or publicly from friends in your Instant Messages list. 


Minibar alerts


Alerts on the minibar signal new activity related to your subscriptions and invites. 
Message alerts display recently received invites. 
Update alerts display assessments made on items or by people you've subscribed to. 
Subscription alerts display comments made on items or by people you've subscribed to.

About creating quicklinks to Brightspace ePortfolio items
You can create quicklinks to Brightspace ePortfolio content in the same way as other quicklinks. However, the person following the link must have that item shared with them. 
If you include a quicklink to a Brightspace ePortfolio item in a form, reflection, artifact, or presentation, the referenced item does not inherit permissions from the item containing the link. This means that individuals viewing an item via the quicklink must also have direct permission to view the referenced item and follow the link; otherwise, they receive an error message letting them know they do not have permission to view the item.
Ignore shared items from a user
If you have the appropriate permissions, you can ignore shared items from other users. Once you ignore a user, all items (including items you are subscribed to) and invites belonging to them are hidden from your Announcements feed, the Unread Invites area, the Invites page, and the Explore page.

You would use the first sharing group for items you want to collect general feedback on, and the second sharing group for items that you want others to collaborate on or revise in detail. 
An organization, department, or course can also set up sharing groups and share them with you. Sharing groups that are shared with you are either optional (you can choose to apply them to specific items) or automatic (you have to use them).

Create and insert a video note in Brightspace Editor

 Record videos up to 25 minutes long and add them anywhere where the Brightspace Editor is available. To help ensure all users can learn without barriers, closed captions are automatically created.
Note: The ability to add video notes is controlled by a permission set by your administrator. If you do not see the Add Video Note option, you do not have the required permission. Videos respect the settings you define in the Attributes page.
Navigate to the specific area in your course where you want to add a Video Note (Assignments, Discussions, Quizzes).
Within the Brightspace Editor, click Insert Stuff.

Figure: The Insert Stuff button in Brightspace Editor.
In the new dialog box, click Add Video Note.
Note: Ensure that you allow Brightspace to access your deviceâs camera and microphone.
To record your message, click New Recording.
To finalize your message, click Stop Recording.
Click Next.

Figure: The Insert Video Note dialog box.
Enter a Title, Description, and select Audio Language.
To generate captions automatically, select Automatically generate captions from audio.
Note: You must choose an Audio Language in order to generate captions.
Click Next.
Click Insert.
Reuse video notes
If you created previous video notes, and if you have the permissions to search and insert video notes, you can reuse them where applicable.
Navigate to the specific area where you want to reuse an existing video note.
In the Brightspace Editor, click the Insert Stuff icon.
Click Video Note Search.

Figure: The Video Note Search option within the Insert Stuff dialog box.
Enter your search terms in the Search Notes field, then click Search. You can also perform a blank search to see all search results.
Select the video you want to reuse and click Next.
You can preview the video notes before you insert and reuse it.
Click Insert.
There are two potential reasons your content may not be working:

When using the Insert Stuff framework to add a YouTube video or other embedded media in a Content frame, the certain internet browsers block the content because it is unsecure without informing the user that there is actually an invisible block around where the media should be. This makes it appear as if the insert failed even though the browser is actually blocking the unsecure content. 
To resolve this issue, the URL that is linked from within the Content frames must use https:// and not an http:// URL. It may be necessary to reconsider linking to content If the destination site doesn't have an https://. If it is necessary,  know that you need to enable the ability to view unsecure content.


It is possible your course is Sandboxed. To enhance the security of content files that execute scripts to create extra-rich HTML experiences (such as objects that can execute JavaScript), there is a sandboxing feature that creates a secure iFrame around the HTML file. This allows an HTML file to execute scripts (such as JavaScript) within the iFrame only but will prevent them from executing outside the iFrame (against the domain). This enables some flexibility in creating rich content, and provides reassurance for the security-conscious that end user information remains secure in all situations (such as in courses where non-privileged roles are contributing content.) 
To find out if your course is sandboxed, contact your instructor.

Record audio-video content in Media Library

Media Library offers a consolidated media processing, storage, and streaming option for all audio-video materials. Any media files that you create are stored in the Media Library repository. Use Media Library's Media Player and the Record Webcam option to create content for discussions or assignments in Brightspace. 
Note: Your capabilities in Media Library will vary depending on your institution. If a functionality is not available that you need, contact your instructor or institution.

On your course homepage, navigate to Media Library.
Note: The Media Library tool can be located on your navbar, in Course Tools > Media Library, or More > Media Library.

Troubleshoot missing course content

No content in my course / Missing modules or topics
There are several reasons why course materials might be missing from Content:

The course has not yet started. 

You may have  access to a course, but if the course start date has not yet passed, it is possible that your instructor did not add any materials for you to review.


Reach out to your instructor to learn when you will get access to course content materials.



The content you are looking for is hidden.

Contact your instructor to verify they made the materials you are looking for visible to the class.



The contentâs release conditions are not met.

                            Instructors can set release conditions for content to appear only after certain criteria are met.

For example, a learner must pass âQuiz Aâ before they are able to view âModule Bâ.



Check your course syllabus as information could be included concerning any release conditions that may be attached to content.


Contact your instructor for further information on whether there is a release condition attached to the module that is missing.


Unable to click on Content modules or topics

The content you are trying to click on has a start date that has not yet passed or is associated with an end date that already passed. 

Contact your instructor for further information if the contentâs availability seems incorrect.



Figure: Content topics with future start dates are unavailable.
Error messages when accessing content links
Internal Error message: You will receive this message when the website runs into internal workflow issues. 

If you click on a link that points to an item within a tool in Brightspace (Assignments, Discussions, other Content areas, etc.), go to the tool and check if you can access the item from there.


If you can, contact your instructor and inform them of the broken content link. 


If you canât, contact the D2L Helpdesk for further help in diagnosing the problem.


Figure: If you receive an Internal Error message, contact your instructor, or reach out to the D2L Helpdesk for further help.
Not authorized message: You will receive this message when you donât have access to the page within Brightspace.

If you are clicking a content link that points to an item within a tool in Brightspace (Assignments, Discussions, other Content areas, etc.), go to the tool and check if you can access the item from there.

If you can, contact your instructor and inform them of the issue you are encountering. 


If you canât, contact your instructor for guidance on next steps.



Figure: If you receive a Not authorized message, contact your instructor
Broken Content links: If you receive an error message when clicking an external link through content and are unable to reach the page, reach out to your instructor to inform them of the broken link they added to the course.
Page not found or 404 error: This error occurs when a link points to a page that does not exist. If you cannot find the linked page, contact your course instructor.
Audio-video files are not playing
If you are unable to play audio or video files in Content, this is most likely the result of a missing plugin required to play the file.

To check whether this is the issue, complete the system check found on the Brightspace login page.


Ensure that all plugins are enabled and update any programs if needed (Java, Adobe, etc.).


You can also restart your browser and clear your cache before trying to play the audio or video file again.


Contact your instructor if you tried all the above and are still encountering an issue.

YouTube videos and other embedded media are not working
When external media (such as YouTube videos) is embedded into the Content tool, your browser may block the content since it is deeming it not secure. This will prevent the media from being played.

To resolve this issue, ensure that you enabled the ability to view unsecured content in your browser.

Course activity expectations and instructions: To receive clarification on any assignment expectations or instructions, reach out to your instructor directly for them to answer your questions.
Downloading content
Click on the content page that you want to download. At the bottom of the page, click Download.
Note: You can only download course content if you have the appropriate permissions assigned to you. If you do not have the permissions to download content, the Download button will not display.

Submit and manage assignments

Understanding due dates and end dates
A due date is the submission deadline of an assignment in your course. This date is specific to assignments only. 
End dates are attached to assignments. The end date is the final date an assignment is available for you to submit to, regardless of the due date. Once the end date of the assignment is past, you are no longer able to submit, no matter what the assignment's due date is. 
You can check these dates  and date settings on the Assignment List page. The hover tooltip includes the information about start and end dates with settings to explain how the assignment appears before and after these dates.

Troubleshoot Assignments
You might occasionally experience a problem when attempting to upload your assignment file. This section provides you with the errors you might encounter when uploading your assignment and troubleshooting solutions.
Assignment unable to be submitted or resubmitted
There are multiple reasons for why you may not be able to submit an assignment. You may not be able to submit an assignment for the following reasons:
The end date has passed and your instructor has disabled late submissions.
Access is restricted for your assignment. This could be because your instructor has only made the assignment available for a specific start and end date or you must complete other course activities, like a quiz or view content, before being able to submit your assignment.
Your instructor has turned off the assignment's visibility and made it hidden for learners. 
You are not uploading the correct file type or including specific details for your assignment. For more information about assignment and uploading errors, refer to the latter parts of this topic.
Your instructor only allows one submission for the assignment, so you cannot resubmit your assignment.
You require special access to submit the assignment.
If you cannot submit or resubmit your assignment, contact your instructor and ask them to perform the necessary steps to allow assignment submission.
Assignment is not available or cannot find assignment
Assignments often have start and end dates that control when an assignment is available or visible. Instructors can also control whether an assignment is visible or not for learners when they create the assignment. If you are supposed to be able to access and view your assignment but you can't see it, contact your instructor and ask them to make the assignment available.
If you are having trouble locating your assignment, access the module related to your assignment in the Content tool. If you still can't find your assignment, navigate to the Assignments tool and search for your assignment name. If your assignment is not available in the Assignments tool and should be, contact your instructor.
Error: Field is required. Select at least one file to upload.
You will receive this error message when you click Add before your file gets completely uploaded.
To resolve this, wait until the green loading bar on your file name has finished loading and click Add.
Error: This file extension is not allowed
When you attempt to upload a file submission for an assignment of a file extension type that the instructor restricted, an error message appears.

Figure: An alert message indicating that a restricted file cannot be uploaded.
To resolve this, before uploading a file, review the allowable file types listed on the Submit Assignment dialog and upload only the allowable file type.

Figure: Submit an assignment file of the type listed in the Allowable File Extensions section.
Error: Oops, your file could not be uploaded
The cause of this error message may be due to an invalid file name, network issues, or if the file that is being uploaded is beyond the file upload limit.
To troubleshoot and resolve this issue, check the following:
File name. Your file does not upload when:
The file name contains illegal characters. The file name should not contain illegal characters. Rename your file and try uploading again. Some examples of illegal characters are: \ / : * ? â < > | ~ # % & ' { }
The file name is too long. We recommend that you keep the file name under 120 characters.
File size. The File Upload function in Brightspace supports up to 2GB per file, depending on your organizationâs settings.
To reduce the file size
If your file contains images, you can reduce the resolution or size of the images.
If your file contains many pages, try splitting this into two files. For example, in a presentation, you can create one file for slides 1-5 and one file for slides 6-10.
Internet connection
The file uploader in Brightspace uploads files in 10MB chunks. If one 10MB chunk takes longer than two minutes to upload, the upload process times out and your file will not continue to upload.
Your upload speed depends on your Internet connection.
Always upload files using a wired Internet connection rather than wireless whenever possible.
If you have access to a faster network, upload from this network (For example, Home, on campus).
To check your Internet connection speed
Go to an Internet speed test site and test your i=Internet speed.
Your upload speed determines how fast your file uploads. Along with the overall size of your file, a larger file takes longer to upload. Although there is no minimum Internet connection speed necessary to use Brightspace, the better your upload speed, the faster your files will upload.
Upload the correct file
When you save a file in Microsoft Office, like a file called assignment.docx, you may find two files saved on your computer: assignment.docx and ~$assignment.docx.
This is because Office creates both a temporary file and the document file, where the temporary file begins with ~$. Ensure you are uploading the actual document instead of the temporary file as the temporary file will not open and contains no data.
Error: Unavailable Quicklink
You may encounter this error when you click the assignment submission folder link from the Content tool or on an announcement post.
The cause of this error is if the assignment folder is not visible on the Assignments page because it may have been hidden, has a release condition, or does not exist. If the assignment is visible but grayed out, either the assignment has not opened yet or itâs already closed.
Contact your instructor for further help accessing the assignment submission folder if this is the case.

Figure: The Unavailable Quicklink error appears after clicking the assignment submission link.
Browser issues
You may encounter an issue with uploading your assignment when the page is not loading properly, the assignment page is blank, or the page is unresponsive.
In this case, we recommend that you make sure youâre using a supported web browser. If the browser is supported, make sure it is updated.

When you complete a quiz attempt or return later to view your quiz results you can check that your attempt was submitted on the Quiz Results page.Figure: The Quiz Results page.
Take a quiz with negative grading enabled
Your instructor may have negative grading enabled for a quiz. This is intended to discourage you from guessing on quiz questions by deducting a percentage of the point value for a quiz question if you answer incorrectly. For example, if a quiz question is graded out of 1 point, your instructor may set that question to deduct 25% or 0.25 points from that quiz question if you answer incorrectly. If you are about to start a quiz with negative grading enabled, the quiz Summary page provides instructions to notify you.

Figure:Â Review the quiz Summary page to determine if your quiz has negative grading enabled.
Once you select Start Quiz, and begin answering questions, you can select Clear Selection to clear any multiple-choice or true or false questions  you have answered, but are unsure about. Clearing your answer ensures that you are given a grade of 0 for the question when you submit, instead of being deducted a percent value for a possible incorrect answer.

Figure:Â Select Clear Selection to clear any multiple-choice or true or false questions that you are unsure about.
Retake a quiz
You can retake a quiz at any time by following the steps described on this page.Â However, the ability to access a quiz depends on how your instructor has set up the quiz. Your instructor may have applied conditions to the quiz that disables your ability to take the quiz again.
You may not be able to access and retake the quiz if:
The quiz  has passed an allowable time limit.
The quiz has passed a due date, or has an availability date range that has passed.
You have exceeded the limit on the number of allowable quiz attempts.
If you want to retake a quiz that is no longer available, you must contact your instructor to have them make the quiz available to you again.

Using the Surveys tool

Submit course feedback with the Surveys tool
Surveys are like quizzes where you will be given a group of questions to answer.  However, the purpose of a survey is not for evaluation, but instead is used to gather your feedback and insights on things like your course materials or your instructorâs teaching methods.
To access and complete a survey

On your course homepage, navigate to the survey you want to take. This could be located in places like your Calendar or in Content.


Click the survey you want to take.


Figure: Click the survey you want to take in the Surveys tool.

Enter your responses for the survey.

Note: You may only be able to complete the survey once. You may also only be able to complete the survey once but may have permission to edit your responses until the surveyâs end date.

Click Save Responses to save your survey responses and finish the rest later. When you are done, click Submit Survey.

No, the Survey tool is designed to be an assessment tool in courses and provide a way for instructors to solicit feedback from participants regarding any aspect of a course. 



--------------------------------------------------


Using Rubrics

Overview of theÂ Rubrics tool
Use rubrics as a guideline to complete course activities like Assignments and Discussions. Rubrics provide you with clear expectations on how you should complete course activities, how you will be assessed on specific activities, and provide you with next steps for future learning improvement.
Visual Tour: Rubrics

Figure: A rubric is organized into various sections, which are described below.

Criteria: The specific standards that your instructor will be marking your work on.


Levels: The different levels of performance that your instructor outlined for each of the criteria chosen.


Criterion Score: The score of a criterion that your instructor gave you based on the work they are assessing.


Total: The sum of your work based on the accumulation of criteria scores.


Overall Score: The overall score that your work falls under based on points.

How rubrics relate to your grade
Rubrics are used to assess your achievement on course activities (assignments and discussions), based on predefined achievement levels and assessment criteria. They help ensure that activities are evaluated fairly and consistently, and can enable you to view the grading criteria before submitting activities. 

Figure: You can see your grade for each section of a Graded rubric highlighted in blue, as well as feedback for your assignment
Rubrics are associated directly with course activities, so you may have the option to view the criteria used to assess your activity before you submit your work. However, in some cases, your instructor may choose to hide a rubric for an activity until it is graded and feedback is published. This may be done to prevent learners from using rubrics as answer keys for activities. For example, your instructor may describe assessment expectations in assignment instructions, hiding the associated preview rubric. Once the assignment is graded, your instructor releases the graded rubric as part of your assessment details.
Note: Previous evaluations are not affected if your instructor changes the status of the rubric to archived.
The graded rubric for the activity includes achieved criteria, personalized feedback, and score. In some cases, the activity includes a link to the graded rubric. For example, a discussion shows instructor feedback, score, and a link to the graded rubric.
When you are notified that your grade for an activity is released or updated, you can view the feedback from the respective tool. For example, to view assignment feedback, navigate to Assignments. 
Note: Depending on how Brightspace is configured in your organization, you may also navigate to Grades, User Progress, and Content to view completed rubric feedback for activities. In User Progress, you can only see the names of the rubrics if there are multiple rubrics attached to an activity.

Set up the Brightspace Portfolio app

You can set up Brightspace Portfolio on a personal device or a shared family device. Your instructor may set up Brightspace Portfolio on a shared classroom device.
Depending on the device you choose, Brightspace Portfolio offers several modes for different types of learners:
In-Class Mode and At Home provides a workflow suited to more advanced learners, with opportunity to include reflections using audio or text.Figure:Â In-Class Mode in the Brightspace Portfolio app
In-Class With Funster and At Home With Funster provides a workflow with a fun creature to help guide early learners through the process. In Funster mode, instructors can decide whether they want learners to record reflections on their work.Figure: Funster mode in the Brightspace Portfolio app

Watch how to set up Brightspace Portfolio on your device

Use the Brightspace Portfolio app at home
Brightspace Portfolio Home mode  supports young learners, their parents, and their teachers while they are learning from home.
The Funster mode was originally designed to be very easy to use for a young learner, while requiring minimal assistance from a teacher in a classroom setting. It assumes a teacher controls a shared classroom device, such as an tablet and scans the classroom card before students can use the device to capture photos and reflections. Itâs a great tool for a classroom and this functionality continues to exist.
Now that kids are all learning at home, the dynamic has changed. There might be multiple kids in a family, all in different grades with different teachers, and it would be onerous for a teacher to individually send the class card and student cards to all parents. 
Inform your learners and parents about Brightspace Portfolio Home mode by directing them to the Brightspace Portfolio At Home blog post, enabling them to self-serve their learner passcards containing their individual QR Codes and access Home mode. Optionally, Home mode for Teachers now enables you to download your class QR Codes individually for distribution.
Note: QR Codes contain private information and should be treated as such.
As learners collect evidence with Brightspace Portfolio Home Mode, the evidence appears on the Approve Evidence page for your class in Brightspace.
Print a learner passcard for Brightspace Portfolio Home Mode
Ensure that your device (such as an iPad, iPhone, or Android device) has the latest version of Brightspace Portfolio.To either download Brightspace Portfolio for the first time or to update it, in the App Store (for iOS) and Google Play Store (for Android), search for Brightspace Portfolio and click Install or Update.
On a computer, as a learner, log in to Brightspace.
From your personal menu, click My Portfolio.
Click Print Class Passcards. 
Use the download link () to download your personal passcard. You can either print the passcard or save it locally on your device for future use.
Note: Your student will need to use these passcards every time they log evidence. If you are printing the QR code, print it in high quality and at 100% scale.
Using Brightspace Portfolio Home Mode for Students and Parents
On your iOS or Android device, launch the Brightspace Portfolio app.
Select Family Device. 
Then choose At Home or At Home with Funster; if selected, the Funster will provide friendly guidance for the learner. 
Scan your personal passcard, and begin capturing evidence of your learning.

Collect evidence

Collect and upload photo and video evidence for a course
Use Brightspace Portfolio to collect photo and video evidence of your learning in the classroom, at home, or on excursions. How you collect evidence with Brightspace Portfolio depends on the device you are using (class, personal, or family device) and the mode (Class Device, Family Mode, My Device).
After collecting evidence, you upload it to your class portfolio using the Brightspace Portfolio app or the Portfolio tool in Brightspace. 
Important: Depending on how your course is configured, your instructor may need to approve any evidence you submit before it appears in your portfolio. Hence, there may be a delay between when you upload the evidence and when it appears in your portfolio.
View recent evidence
To provide an intuitive workflow for uploading and approving evidence, the Brightspace Portfolio app in At Home and My Device mode includes a Recent Evidence list. From this list, you can view captured evidence that is uploading, awaiting approval by your instructor, and approved (added to your portfolio).
From the capture screen in the Brightspace Portfolio app, a Recent Evidence icon displays. Tapping the icon displays the Recent Evidence list. Each item includes the title of the evidence, the date it was uploaded, and the status of the upload. Tapping Back takes you back to the capture screen.
Notes:
The Recent Evidence list displays evidence submitted within the last 30 days by the current user on the current device.
After you upload evidence, the status is refreshed after 10 minutes.
                If Brightspace Portfolio cannot retrieve the status of evidence (the evidence was deleted, no internet connection), the status displays as "Not Available."

Collect and upload evidence not linked to a course
While most learners capture evidence of learning for the courses they are enrolled in, some learning may occur outside of courses. In this case, those learners still need to collect evidence of learning in an independent location where assessment by an instructor is unnecessary. For example, program learning in higher education, extracurricular activities, internships, or independent learning/research. For these learning environments, your administrator can enable a workflow that allows you to collect evidence and choose whether to link it to a course or not. Evidence that is not linked to a course is known as unlinked evidence.
Note the following:
Evidence not linked to a course is hidden to instructors. This means that evidence cannot be assessed by instructors unless you link the evidence to a course.
If Instructor sharing is enabled, you must first link the evidence to a course and then share it with the instructor.  Instructor sharing is not automatic when evidence is linked to a course and instructor sharing is enabled.
If you remove or change a linked course, all class categories are removed from the linked evidence.
If a piece of evidence is shared with an instructor and it contains feedback, rubrics, or outcomes, you cannot remove or change the linked course.
If you do not have unlinked evidence, the image preview for the Unlinked Evidence tile defaults to the org-defined theme color. Once you upload unlinked evidence, the most recent piece of evidence is selected as the preview image for the tile.

Share evidence and review feedback

To allow you to share evidence with instructors, an administrator must turn on this workflow.
Once instructor sharing is turned on by an administrator, you can only share evidence with instructors from the Portfolio tool in Brightspace.
If you are currently using Brightspace Portfolio and your administrator turns on instructor sharing for the first time, any existing evidence that was previously visible to instructors continues to be visible. However, any new evidence will not be visible to instructors until you share it.
Evidence containing feedback, rubrics, or outcomes cannot be unshared with instructors.
Archived evidence can be shared and then unshared with instructors, even if it contains feedback, rubrics, or outcomes.
Learners can also share evidence with instructors by clicking the (...) Options menu on an evidence tile and selecting Share with Instructors.
When you share evidence with an instructor, the date and time the evidence is shared is added to the evidence, visible to you and the instructor. However, the date and time that the evidence was collected is only visible to you.

Troubleshooting Brightspace Pulse

Logging in
Why can't IÂ log in?
If you cannot connect to your school or organization, the problem could be:
Your school or organization turned off access to Brightspace Pulse. 
You entered your ID or password incorrectly or all caps are on (login credentials are case-sensitive).  Use the same credentials you use to log in to your school or organizationâs Brightspace.
If you are still unable to log in, contact your school or organizationâs help desk. They can troubleshoot specific issues you may experience with logging in to Brightspace Pulse.
Why can't IÂ find my school or organization when IÂ search?
If your organization or school does not display in the list when you search, you can add it manually by typing the URL for your school or organization's Brightspace. This field is available when there are zero search results or if you choose to disable your mobile device's geolocation service.
Calendar
Where are my dates?
Brightspace Pulse displays dates added to a course by your instructor. If your instructor has not added dates, they do not appear in the app. Check your course syllabus for due dates that might not appear in the app. If you want to use Brightspace Pulse as your main reference tool for schoolwork, you can add any dates (and personal dates) to the calendar by tapping the Add activity icon: (iOS) or  (Android).
Where did my dates go?
If your dates disappeared or arenât displaying, check your internet connection and refresh the page. Depending on the time of day, it may take a few attempts before the dates load.
Can I add my own calendar items?
Yes, you can add your own calendar items for any course in Brightspace Pulse. Adding a personal date provides you with a link to that courseâs homepage in a web browser.Note: Any dates you add are local to your device, and are not synchronized to Brightspace.
I added my own calendar items, but I can't see them on my new device.
Currently, personal dates do not persist across devices. If you are using Brightspace Pulse on a phone and tablet, or upgraded to a new phone, those personal dates are not visible on both devices. You can re-add them, if necessary.
How can I mark Work To Do activities as complete?
Work To Do completion is synchronized with the activity in Brightspace. So, for an activity to be marked as complete in Brightspace Pulse, it must be completed where appropriate in Brightspace. You can complete an activity by tapping the Work To Do item, then tapping the link in the activity details view. Once the activity is completed, and the data is updated (you can pull to refresh for faster updates), the checkmark should darken to indicate that itâs complete. If you add a Work To Do item manually, you can mark it as complete by tapping the Mark As Complete button in the Work To Doâs detail view. If you are on the week view, the calendar graph adjusts to the completed work, becoming flatter as you mark activities as complete.
Why don't percentage values appear for any of my activities?
While Brightspace Pulse can retrieve data from your courses in Brightspace, it cannot determine percentage values for individual activities. Percentage values must be manually added in Brightspace Pulse.
What does the graph indicate?
How can I turn the graph on or off?
You can toggle where the graph appears by tapping the Menu icon and then Graph Settings. From there, you can choose which tabs you want the graph to appear on. When the graph is turned off, your date items appear in a list.
Notifications
I don't have any notifications.
If you are receiving notifications in Brightspace (from a browser), but not in the  Notifications tab in Brightspace Pulse, there could be an issue with how your school configured the app.
Can I delete old notifications?
Currently, you cannot delete old notifications in the Notifications tab.
Courses
Why  can't IÂ see the courses that I am enrolled in?
It's possible that the courses you're enrolled in haven't started yet or they don't have any dates associated with them.
Where are my grades?
In Brightspace Pulse, you receive notifications for grades in the Notifications tab, which you can open and review at your leisure. To see a centralized view of your grades, tap the  Courses tab, open the course homepage, and navigate to the grades section of your course.
How do I submit an assignment or take a quiz?
You can submit an assignment or take a quiz from the Upcoming tab or Courses tab. From the Upcoming tab, if the assignment or quiz has a due date associated with it, open the details of that activity, and then tap the button at the bottom of the page to launch that activity in your mobile browser. From the Courses tab, you can open the course homepage by selecting a course  and completing the associated activity in the browser.
Content
Why can't I see my course content?
If you canât see your course content, it is likely due to how your school or organization configured the content, making it inaccessible to Brightspace Pulse. Contact your school or organization's help desk.
I open a file but it's blank.It is possible that the content you are trying to access is in a file type that is incompatible with your device.
I don't see updated course content in the Notifications tab
Course content updates only appear in the Notifications tab if the instructor checks the Notify students that the content has changed option for the updated content in Brightspace. This applies to the classic Content experience only; updates do not appear for new Content experience (Lessons). Contact your instructor for more information.
I don't see any updates in the Notifications tab or I cannot access my course documents, announcements, grades, etc.
When you initially log in to Brightspace Pulse, no course content updates appear until new updates come from Brightspace; however, introductory updates appear. The Brightspace Pulse app provides you with updates when announcements are created in your courses and when you receive new grades from your instructors.
Offline Content
What files can I view offline in Brightspace Pulse for iOS?
Brightspace Pulse allows you to save files for offline viewing; however, you must first open the file in Brightspace Pulse while connected to the internet and mark it as Make available offline. On iOS devices, you can view the following files offline:
Images (bmp, gif, png, jpeg, jpg, svg)

Getting approval for a course enrollment
Sometimes, you might be required to get approval before you can enroll in a course or program. In some cases, there may be more than one person identified who can grant approval; however, only one approval is required. 
There are two types of approval. With prefigured approval, the administrator defines one or more people who can approve course enrollment. An example of this type of approval is when an instructor has the authority to approve enrollment for students in their course offering. With learner-provided approval, the learner provides the email address of the person who can approve the course enrollment. An example of this type of approval is when a learner in a corporate environment requires their team lead or business unit manager to approve a course.
If the course you want to enroll in requires approval, you cannot successfully register for the course or program while the approval is pending. To complete the enrollment approval process:
From the Course Catalog course listings, select a course.
Click Request Approval.
If required, type the email address of the person who can approve your course enrollment request.
To add another approver, click Add Another. Then type the email address of the approver.
Read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and complete the enrollment information required for this course.
Click Request Approval.

Awards FAQ
What's the difference between a Badge and a Certificate?
Badges are awarded based on any criteria determined by your instructor. They are meant to provide digital markers that represent accomplishment throughout a course or program.
Certificates are also awarded based on criteria determined by your instructor. Certificates are similar to Badges, however, they include a PDF that you can print.
To learn more, refer to Awards.
I just received an award, but there's no option to share it externally. How can I create a link to share it externally when there's only an internal sharing option?
The ability to share awards externally is determined by your institution. Contact your instructor or your institution if you want to share your awards externally.

Review feedback and rubrics

First, verify with your instructor that feedback is available for viewing.
If your instructor informs you that feedback is available for the activity, you can view the feedback from the respective tool. Depending on how Brightspace is configured for your  institution, there are several ways you can view feedback: Discussions, Assignments, Quizzes, and Grades. 
How rubrics relate to your grade
Rubrics are used to assess your achievement on course activities (assignments and discussions), based on predefined achievement levels and assessment criteria. They help ensure that activities are evaluated fairly and consistently and can enable you to view the grading criteria before submitting activities. 

Figure: Graded rubric feedback for an assignment
Rubrics are associated directly with course activities, so you may have the option to view the criteria used to assess your activity before you submit your work. However, in some cases, your instructor may choose to hide a rubric for an activity until it is graded and feedback is published. This may be done to prevent learners from using rubrics as answer keys for activities. For example, your instructormay describe assessment expectations in assignment instructions, hiding the associated preview rubric. Once the assignment is graded, your instructor releases the graded rubric as part of your assessment details.
Note: Previous evaluations are not affected if your instructor changes the status of the rubric to archived.
The graded rubric for the activity includes achieved criteria, personalized feedback, and score. In some cases, the activity includes a link to the graded rubric. For example, a discussion shows instructor feedback, score, and a link to the graded rubric.
When you are notified that your grade for an activity is released or updated, you can view the feedback from the respective tool. 
Note: Depending on how Brightspace is configured in your organization, you may also go to Grades, User Progress, and Content to see completed rubric feedback for activities. In User Progress, you can only see the names of the rubrics if there are multiple rubrics attached to an activity.
